# What Does iRobot's Bankruptcy Mean for the Future of U.S. Robots? + 2026 Predictions! | EP 169

## Summary

This three-part episode begins with an interview with iRobot co-founder Colin Angle, who explains how the iconic Roomba maker ended up in bankruptcy -- now being taken over by Chinese creditor Pyia Robotics. Colin argues iRobot was "roadkill" in the government's broader antitrust campaign against Amazon, which had offered to buy the company for $1.7 billion in 2022. He admits some strategic mistakes, particularly being late to add wet mopping, but fiercely defends the camera-over-LIDAR approach and warns that the US risks ceding the consumer robotics industry to China.

The second segment features the hosts' annual predictions for 2026. Casey predicts social media bans for under-16s will spread globally, Democrats will win midterms on anti-AI sentiment, and OpenAI will retire Sora. Kevin predicts an AI company will solve a Millennium Prize math problem, an AI-generated work will be nominated for a major entertainment award, and Apple will replace Tim Cook with an outside CEO (with dark horse candidates including Jony Ive, Brian Chesky, and Mira Murati). Both agree the AI bubble won't pop catastrophically but that SaaS companies may start to struggle.

The episode closes with the annual Hard Forking Christmas carol, a tech-themed rendition of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" featuring items like "eight Mecca Hitlers," "five bum bum creams," and "a bot trained on all our IP."

### "We Got Wet Mopping Wrong"

> "Honestly, we got wet mopping wrong. We built our first mopping robot two years after Roomba and we felt like creating an independent mopping solution was the right strategy. But the customer didn't go for it. It was never going to work as an independent product. I deserve arrows for mopping."

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=0s) I'm Kevin Roose, a tech columnist at the New York Times. I'm Casey Newton from Platformer and this is Hard Fork. This week, iRobot co-creator Colin Angle joins us to talk about why the iconic vacuum company went bankrupt. Then, our 2026 tech predictions, and finally, we're going caroling. A Hard Forking Christmas makes its annual return.

[0:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=39s) A legendary American company is entering an exciting new chapter. That's the bankruptcy chapter. On Sunday, iRobot, maker of the Roomba, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after finding itself outcompeted by a bunch of Chinese fast-following companies. iRobot was started in 1990. The first Roomba came out several years later and it has been synonymous with the category of household robot vacuum.

[1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=90s) In 2022, Amazon made an offer to buy the company for $1.7 billion. But antitrust regulators in the US and the EU stepped in and said they'd attempt to block it. In 2024, they officially walked away and the company now is bankrupt. Now iRobot will be owned by Chinese company Pyia Robotics, its largest creditor and a competing manufacturer.

[4:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=240s) Colin explains how Chinese fast followers had access to a protected marketplace. China decided this was a market of interest and ensured Chinese companies were advantaged to succeed. The Chinese government provided direct subsidies to competitors.

[7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=420s) On the LIDAR vs. camera debate, Colin is entertainingly dismissive: "Does your autonomous driving vehicle have LIDAR? No. Why? Because it is a dead-end technology which gives you no situational awareness." He was playing the Tesla card, putting every penny of cost against better visual understanding.

[9:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=580s) Colin admits they got wet mopping wrong. They built Scooba as a separate robot, believing it would give the best customer benefit. But the customer didn't want a separate product -- they wanted mopping as an incremental feature in their vacuum robot. They reacted late and took damage.

[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=810s) On why the FTC blocked the Amazon deal: Colin says iRobot spent tremendous resources over 18 months making the facts clear. "There was nothing unsaid." He believes iRobot was roadkill in a broader anti-Amazon campaign, not the target itself. iRobot's European market share was 12% and declining -- "the definition of a vibrant, dynamic marketplace."

[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=1080s) Colin warns about the implications for the humanoid robotics industry. Billions have been invested in American companies. "Are we going to protect and catalyze American companies to continue to lead? Let's not screw it up. Let's treat this as the golden goose."

[22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=1379s) 2025 predictions scorecard. Casey went 3 for 3: AI culture war began (high confidence), X merged with XAI in March (low confidence), and Waymo went mainstream. Kevin scored about 1.5/3: the Trump memecoin only reached $15B vs. predicted $100B, Waymo arguably went mainstream, and OpenAI did not declare AGI.

[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=1860s) Kevin's high confidence: an AI company will solve a Millennium Prize problem. These are seven of the hardest unsolved math problems, each carrying a million-dollar prize. DeepMind is reportedly working on the Navier-Stokes equations.

[34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=2040s) Casey's medium confidence: Democrats win midterms on anti-AI sentiment. Bernie Sanders called for a moratorium on data center construction. NIMBY movements against data centers are powerful political tools. Resolution criteria: 3 Democrats flip seats espousing anti-AI sentiment.

[42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=2520s) Casey's low confidence: OpenAI retires Sora. The app generated controversy over copyrighted IP, has declining downloads, and is a distraction during their "code red" moment. He predicts video generation will fold into ChatGPT instead.

[48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=2880s) Kevin's low confidence: Apple replaces Tim Cook with an outside CEO. The Financial Times reported Apple stepping up succession planning. Kevin sees Apple as stagnant, coasting on Steve Jobs-era laurels. Dark horse candidates: Jony Ive (return to design roots), Brian Chesky (Apple fanboy, studied Jobs), or Mira Murati (via acquiring Thinking Machines Lab).

[50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQNTk9T-Mrg&t=3000s) Both predict the AI bubble won't catastrophically pop in 2026. Frontier labs will make tens of billions more in revenue. SaaS companies may struggle as businesses build their own tools. Kevin predicts 2026 is the last year to buy a house in San Francisco due to upcoming IPOs from Anthropic, OpenAI, SpaceX, and Stripe.
