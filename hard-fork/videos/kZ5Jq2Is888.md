# The 50 Most Iconic Technologies of 2025: Countdown! | EP 166

## Summary

In their most popular annual tradition, Kevin Roose and Casey Newton count down the 50 most iconic technologies of 2025 -- technologies that had a big year, whether for good or ill. The list spans from the Friend AI pendant at number 50 all the way to data centers at number 1, with detours through everything from the Constitution to Velcro to stochastic gradient descent. The episode blends humor, cultural commentary, and genuine tech analysis as the hosts debate which technologies most defined the year.

The top 10 features major AI stories (DeepSeek at 8, Sora at 9, ChatGPT at 3), geopolitical flashpoints (rare earth metals at 5), a surprising number 1 pick of data centers reflecting the massive infrastructure buildout powering AI, and the controversial Trumpcoin at number 2. The list also includes notable omissions from last year's inaugural 100 technologies list, such as paper, X-rays, and glass, responding to listener feedback. Throughout, Kevin and Casey inject personal anecdotes -- from Casey's Balatro addiction to Kevin's Celsius dependency -- making this both a year-in-review and a comedy special.

## Highlights

> "It would be hard to tell the story of 2025 in technology without the humble data center. This is not just the largest infrastructure project in America of the year but maybe the largest infrastructure project in history."
> -- Kevin Roose, [66:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ5Jq2Is888&t=3987s)

### "Mecca Hitler: When You Can't Control AI Alignment"

> "Here comes Elon Musk, someone with unlimited money, and he wants to make the anti-woke right-wing chatbot. And it turns out that when you do that, it starts calling itself Mecca Hitler. And then when you try to undo that, it turns out you can't actually control the models that well."
> -- Kevin Roose, [59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ5Jq2Is888&t=3540s)

### "Claude Code: A Billion Dollars in Year One"

> "The campaign against plastic straws was started back in 2011 when a 9-year-old Vermont boy, Milo Crest, did a school science project and estimated that Americans were using 500 million straws a day. Do you know where that 9-year-old boy works today? Anthropic."
> -- Kevin Roose, [21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ5Jq2Is888&t=1310s)

### "DeepSeek: They Told Us How They Made It"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZ5Jq2Is888?start=3420&end=3480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> "To this day, the DeepSeek R1 paper is still our best and one of our only sources of information about how these reasoning models are built and what the underlying technology looks like because none of the American companies who are building these models are publishing the details like DeepSeek did."
> -- Kevin Roose, [57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ5Jq2Is888&t=3420s)
