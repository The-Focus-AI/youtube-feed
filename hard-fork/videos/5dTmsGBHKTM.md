# An A.I. Assistant That's Too Good to Be True?

## Summary

This episode of Hard Fork covers three major topics. First, Kevin and Casey discuss the tech industry's response to ICE killings in Minneapolis, examining how surveillance technology, social media platforms, and AI-generated imagery are playing roles in the crisis. They analyze statements from Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, and Tim Cook, and explore how the government is using content creators and influencers to control narratives. The "phone vs phone" dynamic in Minneapolis -- where both protesters and the government are using smartphones as weapons in the information war -- represents a new phase in American civic conflict.

Second, Casey reveals his firsthand experience installing Moltbot (formerly Claudebot) on his laptop, the open-source AI agent that has captured Silicon Valley's imagination. Despite significant security risks -- including potential for hackers to take over your computer through messaging app integrations and prompt injection attacks -- Casey wired it up to his email and calendar to create a personal daily briefing. The results work about 70% of the time, highlighting both the compelling vision of an AI assistant that can do anything on your computer and the reality that these tools aren't quite ready for prime time. The episode explores why this matters despite its current limitations, connecting it to the widening gap between AI early adopters and everyone else.

Finally, the hosts play HatGPT, covering Amazon's "Project Dawn" layoffs, Caroline Ellison's prison release, TikTok's data center outage, Dario Amodei's 19,000-word essay, a porn-quitting app that leaked user data, an Alaska student who ate AI-generated art in protest, Steak 'n Shake's Bitcoin strategy, Apple's AI wearable pin, the White House Melania doc screening, SpaceX's astrology-timed IPO, and LinkedIn's vibe coding badges.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=0s) I'm Kevin Roose, a tech columnist at the New York Times. I'm Casey Newton from Platformer and this is Hard Fork. This week, phone-to-phone combat in the streets. We'll talk about the tech industry's response to ICE killings in Minneapolis. Then it's the reason Mac minis are sold out across San Francisco. We'll tell you about the sensation now known as Moltbot. And finally, it's time once again for HatGPT.

[0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=30s) So today we want to start by turning our attention to Minneapolis and the ongoing confrontation between ICE officers and protesters. Kevin and I have both been horrified by the fatal shooting of Alex Prey, the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal agents this month. And while we don't often turn our attention directly to matters of politics and protests on the show, we both believe that the tech industry is playing a role in this story.

[1:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=72s) Yeah, I've been really horrified by what's been going on in Minneapolis. I have family in Minneapolis. They're scared. Some of them are leaving. It is a really tense and hard time in American civic life right now and I think we should talk today about not just how the big tech companies and their leaders are acting right now but what role technology itself is playing in some of the reaction to these shootings.

[1:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=96s) The tech industry is playing a significant role in what is happening right now. It is an infrastructure provider behind many of the key tools being used -- primarily surveillance tech that ICE is relying on to identify and detain migrants, but also the social platforms where once again we're seeing violence being turned into content and influencers on both sides trying to make it go viral.

[2:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=137s) Let's start with the CEOs. Sam Altman of OpenAI, Dario Amodei of Anthropic, and Tim Cook of Apple each made statements or sent internal memos to their employees lamenting what was going on. Sam Altman had an internal Slack message describing ICE as going too far. Dario called the events in Minnesota horror. Tim Cook sent an internal message saying this is a time for deescalation.

[3:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=213s) In several of these cases, we are seeing these CEOs say about the least that they possibly could. They are very afraid of irritating the White House. At the same time they're facing a lot of pressure from their employees to say something.

[7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=420s) ICE now essentially has a team of content creators who work at the agency and who are spending every day trying to steer the narrative using the same techniques that a brand or a celebrity would. These agencies are not just thinking that their jobs are enforcing the law -- they are also trying to control the narrative around how they enforce the law.

[9:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=580s) The White House released an AI-altered image of a civil rights attorney named Nikima Levy Armstrong who went to an anti-ICE protest and was arrested. They put out this image to make her look like she's crying when she wasn't. JD Vance retweeted the image. When asked, a spokesman for the White House just said "the memes will continue." Which I honestly found chilling.

[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=720s) Smartphones are playing a central role in this conflict. Alex Prey was holding a phone when he was shot. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on Americans not to film. DHS Secretary Christy Gnome said videotaping is anything that threatens agents and their safety. But it is not illegal to film law enforcement. It is not doxing to post the image of a federal agent operating on behalf of the state.

[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=1200s) Casey, speaking of extreme risk-takers, I hear you have actually been experimenting with some new technology this week. I have installed Maltbot, formerly known as Claudebot, onto my laptop and I've said, "Damn the consequences."

[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=1320s) Claudebot, now Moltbot, was created by a developer named Peter Steinberger. He started it to scratch his own itch -- he observed that there was no great personal assistant agent yet and wondered if he could use Claude Code through WhatsApp.

[23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=1380s) There is the risk that somebody can hack into your computer. Claudebot can connect to Telegram. If somebody hacks into your Telegram account, they could take over your entire computer. There's the prompt injection attack risk -- you visit a website that has hidden instructions and the agent follows them. Don't do this. Don't do what Casey does.

[28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=1710s) What Moltbot does better than Claude Code is memory. It writes memories to a markdown file and continuously revisits them. It's been better at understanding that if you built a tool the previous day and want to tweak it, it knows where to look.

[30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=1850s) I connected it to my email, my calendar, a few other services. I said I want you to tell me whenever there's a new pro wrestling pay-per-view. I want you to tell me about new episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race. Every Thursday tell me what movies are coming out. By hook and by crook over a handful of days, I got something that works about 70% of the time.

[35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=2100s) A user named Alex Finn showed his Moltbot -- he asked "Can you make a reservation for me at this restaurant?" The bot said "I can't book directly through Open Table right now, but if you want me to just call them, I can call and book under your name." And the bot actually used a synthetic voice from 11 Labs to call the restaurant and place the reservation.

[39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=2350s) I've never seen such a yawning inside-outside gap. People in San Francisco are putting multi-agent Claude swarms in charge of their lives, consulting chatbots before every decision, wireheading to a degree only sci-fi writers dared to imagine. People elsewhere are still trying to get approval to use Copilot in Teams, if they're using AI at all.

[42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=2520s) Andrej Karpathy said that programs like Claude Code and Codex are easily the biggest change to his basic work coding workflow in two decades of programming, and it happened over the course of a few weeks. If that is true for him, the most accomplished programmer, it is also true for other programmers. And if it is true for programmers, it is probably true for people in other areas.

[44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=2670s) Some Amazon employees got a calendar invitation titled "Project Dawn" discussing upcoming job cuts. That's bad. We shouldn't do that. That's like a sci-fi video game where Project Dawn was the name of an effort to wipe out all of humanity. Just say Project Layoffs.

[50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dTmsGBHKTM&t=3000s) Dario Amodei published a new 38-page, 19,000-word essay called "The Adolescence of Technology." This is a follow-up to "Machines of Loving Grace." That one was optimistic; this one is about all the scary things that could happen as a result of AI.
