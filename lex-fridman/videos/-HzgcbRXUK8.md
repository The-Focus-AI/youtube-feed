# Demis Hassabis: Future of AI, Simulating Reality, Physics and Video Games

## Summary

This is the second time Demis Hassabis appears on the Lex Fridman podcast, now as a Nobel Prize winner for his groundbreaking work in protein structure prediction using AI. Demis is the leader of Google DeepMind and one of the most brilliant minds working on understanding and building intelligence.

The conversation explores learnable patterns in nature, computation and P vs NP, how video generation models like Veo 3 are learning to understand reality, the path to AGI, scaling laws, the future of energy to power AI, and Google's position in the race to AGI. They also discuss the origin of life, consciousness, quantum computation, and what it means to simulate a biological organism.

## Highlights

### "Video models are reverse engineering physics from YouTube"

```bash

```

> "If you look at Veo, our video generation model, it can model liquids surprisingly well - materials, specular lighting. I used to write physics engines and graphics engines in gaming. It's painstakingly hard to build programs that do that. Yet these systems are reverse engineering from just watching YouTube videos."
> — Demis Hassabis, [14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HzgcbRXUK8&t=874s)

### "Perhaps most of reality has a lower dimensional manifold"

```
</details>

> "Perhaps there is some kind of lower dimensional manifold that can be learned if we actually fully understood what's going on under the hood. That's maybe true of most of reality."
> — Demis Hassabis, [14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HzgcbRXUK8&t=874s)

### "P(doom) and human resilience"

```
</details>

> "If p(doom) is actually high at some point, all of humanity will be aligned in making sure that's not the case. There's a self-modulating aspect. I have a lot of faith in humanity rising up to meet that moment."
