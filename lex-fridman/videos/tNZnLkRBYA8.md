# ThePrimeagen: Programming, AI, ADHD, Productivity, Addiction, and God

## Summary

In this deeply personal and wide-ranging conversation, Lex Fridman sits down with Michael Paulson, better known online as ThePrimeagen. Prime is a legendary programmer who has entertained and inspired millions to build software and have fun doing it. From his viral programming streams on Twitch to his educational YouTube content, Prime has become one of the most influential voices in the programming community.

The conversation spans Prime's incredible life story - from his struggles with porn addiction, to finding God, to his career at Netflix where he worked on Falcor (the JavaScript GraphQL client), to his rise as a content creator. They dive deep into technical topics like debugging with printf statements, the best programming languages in 2025, why Rust is transformative, and whether HTML is technically a programming language.

Prime also shares candid insights about living with ADHD, his unconventional productivity methods (including a standing desk setup that would make most ergonomics experts cringe), and his philosophy on programming with AI. The episode concludes with profound discussions about faith, perseverance through hardship, and advice for young programmers trying to find their path.

## Highlights

### "My mind exploded when I saw a class that contains itself"

```
</details>

> "It was the second class in data structures and the teacher was talking about linked lists. He shows code and it's like abstract class node and then it had a private member of type node. For the first time ever, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, there's no end. This is not a set of 10 items. This is a set of infinite items.' My mind kind of exploded in that moment."
> — ThePrimeagen, [0:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=42s)

### "I would've been the guy who took advantage of all my friends"

> "If I didn't have God in my life, I would've been the guy who took advantage of all my friends. I would've been a real piece of garbage person. I had this thing in me that God reached in and grabbed and was like, 'No, you don't get to be that.' Without that I would not be who I am today."
> — ThePrimeagen, [37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2256s)

### "Printf debugging is the superior form of debugging"

```
</details>

> "I think printf debugging is superior to traditional debugging in many ways. When you add a print statement, you're explicitly stating 'I believe this value should be X at this point.' It forces you to reason about your code. Debuggers let you be lazy."
> — ThePrimeagen, [1:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5809s)

### "I broke Netflix production with one line of code"

```
</details>

> "I broke Netflix production. One line of code. It took out Falcor for about 45 minutes globally. That's 200 million users unable to browse Netflix properly. And you know what? I didn't get fired. Netflix had a culture where you learn from mistakes, you don't punish them."
> — ThePrimeagen, [1:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6544s)

### "Rust changed how I think about programming forever"

```
</details>

> "Rust changed how I think about programming forever. Not because of the borrow checker, but because it forces you to think about ownership and lifetimes. Even when I'm writing JavaScript now, I think about who owns this data, how long does it live. That mental model is invaluable."
> — ThePrimeagen, [2:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10063s)

### "AI is the best rubber duck ever invented"

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=0s) The following is a conversation with Michael Paulson, better known online as the ThePrimeagen. He is a programmer who has entertained and inspired millions of people to have fun building stuff with software. Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned developer who has been battling it out in the software engineering trenches for decades. In short, ThePrimeagen is a legendary programmer and a great human being with an inspiring roller coaster of a life story. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's ThePrimeagen.

[0:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=42s) What do you love most about programming? What brings you joy when you program? I can tell you the first time that I ever felt love in programming or felt that joy or that excitement which was in college. It was the second class in data structures and the teacher that was teaching, Ray Babcock, he was talking about linked lists. Now you have to learn Java at Montana State University when I went, and so he's off there kind of explaining this whole linked list thing and all that.

[1:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=75s) And then he shows code and in the code it's like abstract class node or whatever it was. And then it had a private member and that private member was of type node. And I've never seen that before. It is a class that is called node with a member that is of itself. And for the first time ever, I was like, "Oh my gosh, like there's no end. There's no way to iterate. This is not like a set of 10 items. This is a set of infinite items."

[1:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=108s) And so like my mind kind of like exploded in that moment. Like there's actually - like what you can express is huge. I can see what memory looks like. Like I can see this kind of hopping through space. And I just remember being just so blown away because up until that point everything was just all right, I have a list of 10 items. I have a list of 20 items, right? It was very rigid.

[2:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=135s) And suddenly it's like, wait, you can just do anything? Like what? Like this is wild. And so that moment changed everything for me. That was when I knew this is what I wanted to do with my life. The beauty of data structures is that they're not just about organizing data - they're about organizing thought. When you understand a linked list, you understand something fundamental about how we can represent connections and relationships in the abstract.

[3:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=182s) Do you remember the exact moment when it clicked? Yes, I remember sitting there in this old lecture hall at Montana State. The chairs were those wooden ones that fold up, you know the kind. And Professor Babcock is drawing on the chalkboard - yes, we still had chalkboards - and he draws these boxes with arrows pointing to each other. And something just clicked. It was like seeing the Matrix for the first time.

[3:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=225s) The thing about programming that people don't realize is that it's not about typing code. Anyone can type code. It's about thinking in abstractions, about building mental models of systems that don't physically exist. You're literally creating something from nothing. Pure thought materialized into logic that can do work in the real world. That's incredible when you think about it.

[4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=270s) What was your path to becoming a professional programmer? It wasn't straightforward at all. I struggled a lot in high school. I wasn't a good student. I had undiagnosed ADHD which made traditional learning really hard for me. I was the kid who couldn't sit still, couldn't focus on homework, but could hyperfocus on video games for 12 hours straight.

[5:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=315s) College was actually where things started to turn around. Not because college is inherently better, but because I finally found something - computer science - that could hold my attention. Programming is perfect for people with ADHD in some ways. You get constant feedback. You write code, it runs or it doesn't. There's something deeply satisfying about that immediate response.

[6:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=362s) Tell me about the hardest time in your life. Oh man, there have been several. But probably the darkest period was when I was struggling with addiction. I don't talk about this a lot publicly, but I think it's important. I was addicted to pornography for years. It started in high school and continued into college. It affected my relationships, my self-image, everything.

[7:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=435s) The thing about addiction that people don't understand is that it's not about willpower. You can't just decide to stop. Your brain has literally been rewired to crave the dopamine hit. Breaking free required me to completely restructure my life - how I spent my time, who I spent it with, what I allowed into my mind.

[8:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=510s) Faith played a huge role in my recovery. I know that's not popular to say in tech circles, but it's the truth. Finding God gave me a framework for understanding why I should be better, not just how. It gave me accountability, community, and purpose beyond just achieving success for myself.

[9:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=585s) Do you think your struggles made you a better programmer? Absolutely. Here's the thing - programming is all about problem solving, and life's biggest problems aren't in code. Learning to face my own failures, to be honest about my weaknesses, to keep trying even when I wanted to give up - all of that translates directly to how I approach hard technical problems.

[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=615s) What is the hardest part of programming? Oh, it's definitely not the code. The hardest part is understanding what you're supposed to build in the first place. Requirements are almost always unclear. Stakeholders don't know what they want. And even when they do, they change their minds. The technical challenges are solvable - they have right answers. The human challenges? Those are the tricky ones.
