# Paul Rosolie: Uncontacted Tribes in the Amazon Jungle

## Summary

Paul Rosolie is a naturalist, explorer, and author who has dedicated his life to protecting the Amazon rainforest. In this conversation, he shares extraordinary stories from his years in the jungle, including an intense extended encounter with an uncontacted tribe that has never been shown before. Paul discusses the beauty and mysteries of the natural world, the urgent need for conservation, and the delicate balance between protecting indigenous peoples and documenting their existence.

The episode includes never-before-seen footage of uncontacted tribe warriors, intense encounters with wildlife including giant anacondas, dangerous situations with narco-traffickers and cartel members, and Paul's mission through Junglekeepers to protect as much of the Amazon as possible. The conversation explores themes of human connection with nature, the importance of preserving wild spaces, and the profound experiences that come from immersing oneself in one of Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems.

Paul's new book "Junglekeeper" tells the story of these experiences and his mission to protect the Amazon, available in both book and audiobook format.
