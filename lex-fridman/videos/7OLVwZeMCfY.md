# Julia Shaw: Criminal Psychology of Murder, Serial Killers, Memory & Sex

## Summary

Julia Shaw is a criminal psychologist and author whose books explore the darker aspects of human nature, including psychopathy, violent crime, the psychology of evil, police interrogation, false memory manipulation, and human sexuality. Her books include "Evil" (about the psychology behind humanity's dark side), "The Memory Illusion" (about false memories), "Bi" (about bisexuality), and her new book "Green Crime" about environmental criminals including illegal miners and corporate fraudsters.

In this fascinating conversation, Julia discusses the Dark Tetrad personality traits (psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism, and sadism) as a continuum rather than binary labels. She explores why most people have had murder fantasies (70% of men, 50%+ of women), what makes serial killers different, the psychology of lies and scams, jealousy, monogamy, sexual fetishes, false memory implantation, and criminals who are destroying the planet. Julia brings both brilliant analytical insight and genuine kindhearted empathy to understanding the full spectrum of human behavior, from our darkest impulses to our capacity for good.
