# Norman Ohler: Hitler, Nazis, Drugs, WW2, Blitzkrieg, LSD, MKUltra & CIA

## Summary

Norman Ohler is a historian and author of "Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich," a meticulously researched book that investigates the role of psychoactive drugs, particularly stimulants like methamphetamine, in the military history of World War II. The book has received high praise from legendary historians Ian Kershaw and Antony Beevor for its depth of archival research. Norman also wrote "Tripped: Nazi Germany, the CIA, and the Dawn of the Psychedelic Age," and is working on a new book "Stoned Sapiens" examining the history of human civilization through the lens of drugs.

In this comprehensive conversation, Norman reveals how methamphetamine (sold as Pervitin) became widespread in Nazi Germany, how it powered the Blitzkrieg strategy that conquered France in days, Hitler's extensive drug addiction (including methamphetamine, opioids, and cocaine), the role of drugs in military operations throughout WW2, and the surprising connections to post-war CIA experiments with LSD and MKUltra. The discussion also covers the German resistance against Nazis, the nature of totalitarianism, religion's relationship to psychoactive substances throughout human history, writing while on drugs, Berlin nightclub culture, and what Norman considers the greatest book ever written. This is a fascinating exploration of how drugs have shaped history in ways we rarely acknowledge.

## Surprising Quotes
