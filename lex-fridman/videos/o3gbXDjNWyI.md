# Dan Houser: GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar, Absurd & Future of Gaming

## Summary

Dan Houser is co-founder of Rockstar Games and the legendary creative mind behind Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series - some of the most successful and influential video games ever created. In this rare and extensive interview, Dan discusses his creative process, the evolution of open world gaming, and what makes great video game narratives.

The conversation explores Dan's early influences (especially The Godfather Part II), the creation of GTA 3 which pioneered the modern open world genre, the development of GTA 4 and GTA 5, and why Red Dead Redemption 2 might be the greatest video game ever made. Dan shares insights into Rockstar's intense work culture and commitment to excellence, discusses why certain DLCs were never made, and reveals why he left Rockstar after decades. He also talks about his new venture Absurd Ventures, which is creating stories across multiple media including books, film, and yes, video games - including "A Better Paradise" (a dystopian story involving superintelligent AI) and "Absurdiverse" (an action-adventure world). Dan reflects on life lessons from his father, mortality, advice for young people, and the future of video games including the potential role of AI in game development.
