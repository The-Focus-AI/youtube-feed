# Deciphering Secrets of Ancient Civilizations, Noah's Ark, and Flood Myths

## Summary

Irving Finkel is a scholar of ancient languages and longtime curator at the British Museum, renowned for his expertise in Mesopotamian history and cuneiform writing. He specializes in reading and interpreting cuneiform inscriptions from Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian contexts. Irving became widely known for studying a tablet containing a Mesopotamian flood story that predates the biblical Noah narrative, which he presented in his book "The Ark Before Noah" and in a documentary involving the construction of a circular ark based on the tablet's technical instructions.

In this engaging conversation, Irving shares his infectious enthusiasm for ancient history, discussing the origins of writing around 3500 BC, the complexities of deciphering cuneiform script, and how ancient civilizations recorded everything from business transactions to epic literature. He explores ancient beliefs about gods and ghosts, controversial theories about Göbekli Tepe, the Royal Game of Ur (one of the oldest board games), and the evolution of human civilization. The discussion reveals how much we can learn from clay tablets that survived for thousands of years.

## Surprising Quotes

> "The first attempts at writing that we could call writing appeared around 3500 BC. People had clay as their operating material and developed the idea that you could record information on a surface that another person could read."
> — Irving Finkel, [7:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bBRVNkAfkQ&t=424s)

> "They made up signs which everybody understood - foot is a foot, leg is a leg, and barley is barley. Then very quickly they had the idea that pictures could also represent sounds. That's the crucial thing."
> — Irving Finkel, [7:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bBRVNkAfkQ&t=424s)

> "The flood story on the tablet predates the Biblical Noah narrative, showing these myths had ancient Mesopotamian origins."
> — Irving Finkel, [1:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bBRVNkAfkQ&t=4886s)
