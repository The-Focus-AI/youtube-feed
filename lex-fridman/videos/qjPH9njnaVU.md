# Pavel Durov: Telegram, Freedom, Censorship, Money, Power & Human Nature

## Summary

Pavel Durov is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging platform actively used by over 1 billion people. Pavel has spent his life building tools that protect people from surveillance and censorship, facing immense pressure from some of the most powerful governments and organizations on Earth. Despite this, he has always held his ground, continuously fighting for privacy and the freedom of all humans to communicate.

This extraordinary conversation covers Pavel's disciplined lifestyle (no alcohol, no phone except for occasional music, stoic mindset, strict diet and exercise), his philosophy on freedom, his arrest in France, the Kafkaesque situation with Romanian elections, his views on power and corruption, his intense education, working with his brother Nikolai on VK and Telegram, encryption and privacy, pressure from intelligence agencies and governments (Iran, Russia, Apple), a poisoning attempt, his thoughts on money, cryptocurrency (TON and Bitcoin), his approach to fatherhood, quantum immortality, and Kafka. The episode is available in multiple languages (English, Russian, Ukrainian, French, Hindi). Pavel is one of the most principled and fearless humans alive, dedicated to protecting freedom of communication.
