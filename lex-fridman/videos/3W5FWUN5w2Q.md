# Jeffrey Wasserstrom: China, Xi Jinping, Trade War, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mao

## Summary

Jeffrey Wasserstrom is a historian of modern China. The conversation compares Xi Jinping to Mao Zedong - both subjects of personality cults, but while Mao reveled in chaos, Xi values order and control. They discuss Confucius and his modern relevance, education in China, the Tiananmen Square massacre and Tank Man, censorship and the Great Firewall, Xi Jinping's rise to power, Trump's approach to China, the trade war, Taiwan tensions, the Hong Kong protests, and what the future holds for US-China relations.
