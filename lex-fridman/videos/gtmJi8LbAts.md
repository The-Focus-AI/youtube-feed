# Iran War Debate: Nuclear Weapons, Trump, Peace, Power & the Middle East

## Summary

A heated debate between Scott Horton (anti-war activist) and Mark Dubowitz (Foundation for Defense of Democracies) on Iran and Israel. Recorded after the Iran-Israel ceasefire was declared, the debate covers Iran's nuclear program, the nuclear deal (JCPOA), the Iran Nuclear Archive, uranium enrichment, and whether military intervention is justified. The two debaters have fundamentally opposing views on US foreign policy and the path to peace.
