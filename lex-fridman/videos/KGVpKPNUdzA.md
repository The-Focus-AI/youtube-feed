# Khabib vs Lex: Training with Khabib | FULL EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE

## Summary

This video captures Lex Fridman's grappling training session with Khabib Nurmagomedov, one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, at the UFC Performance Institute. The footage shows Lex -- a jiu-jitsu black belt -- being completely overwhelmed by Khabib's grappling pressure across multiple rounds. Despite Lex's credentials, Khabib's wrestling-based top pressure makes him feel, in his own words, "like a white belt."

The video includes two full training rounds between Lex and Khabib, a brief grappling session between Khabib and former UFC champion Glover Teixeira, and candid post-training conversation. Khabib teaches Lex specific techniques between rounds, emphasizing his philosophy of using weight and pressure to make opponents expend energy rather than forcing submissions. The session also features Khabib's training philosophy: he describes going 1.5 hours nonstop in practice, cycling through four or five opponents, driven by a mental resilience where he questions how anyone could make him tired. The video ends with others comparing training with Khabib to "shooting hoops with Michael Jordan at the YMCA."
