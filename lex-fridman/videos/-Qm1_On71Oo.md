# Dave Hone: T-Rex, Dinosaurs, Extinction, Evolution, and Jurassic Park

## Summary

Dave Hone is a paleontologist, expert on dinosaurs, co-host of the Terrible Lizards podcast, and author of numerous scientific papers and books on dinosaur behavior and ecology. In this conversation, Lex explores the world of T-Rex - its massive size (skull so large you could fit through it), hunting strategies, bone-crushing bite force, and why it's the most fascinating creature to ever walk the Earth. They discuss what Jurassic Park got wrong and right, sexual selection in dinosaurs, the mysterious Spinosaurus, cannibalism among T-Rex, and how birds are actually dinosaurs.
