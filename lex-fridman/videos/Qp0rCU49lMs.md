# Michael Levin: Hidden Reality of Alien Intelligence & Biological Life

## Summary

Michael Levin is a biologist at Tufts University working on revolutionary approaches to understand and control complex pattern formation in biological systems. His research explores the boundaries between living and non-living, the nature of biological intelligence, and how groups of cells make collective decisions to build and maintain complex structures like bodies.

In this mind-expanding conversation, Michael discusses how all biological systems - from single cells to entire organisms - exhibit forms of intelligence and agency. He explores the creation of xenobots and anthrobots (synthetic living machines created from frog and human cells), the idea that memories and ideas might themselves be living organisms, and the provocative notion that reality as we perceive it is an illusion - our brains are interfaces to a hidden deeper reality. The discussion covers aging as a reversible defect in morphostasis, the possibility of mind uploading, the search for alien intelligence right here on Earth, and surprising intelligence found in sorting algorithms. Michael's work challenges fundamental assumptions about life, consciousness, and the nature of intelligence itself.
