# Infinity, Paradoxes, Gödel Incompleteness & the Mathematical Multiverse

## Summary

Joel David Hamkins is a mathematician and philosopher specializing in set theory, the foundations of mathematics, and the nature of infinity. He's the #1 highest-rated user on MathOverflow and author of several books including "Proof and the Art of Mathematics" and "Lectures on the Philosophy of Mathematics."

In this deeply philosophical conversation, Joel and Lex explore some of the most mind-bending concepts in mathematics: the idea that some infinities are bigger than others (Cantor's revolutionary discovery), Russell's paradox that threatened to show mathematics is inconsistent, Gödel's incompleteness theorems that prove there are true statements we can never prove, and the distinction between truth and proof. They discuss whether infinity actually exists in reality or is merely a useful mathematical abstraction, explore the mathematical multiverse (the idea that there are multiple valid mathematical realities), and examine beautiful concepts like surreal numbers and Conway's Game of Life.

The conversation covers everything from ancient Greek philosophy to cutting-edge mathematical research, making profound ideas accessible through clear explanations and thoughtful discussion. Topics include the hardest problems in mathematics (like P vs NP and the Continuum Hypothesis), the greatest mathematicians in history, infinite chess, and what Joel considers the most beautiful idea in mathematics.
