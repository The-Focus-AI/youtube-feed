# What does Sam Altman actually want? Cyber-physical ecosystem! | 3 Wow and 1 Promise

## Summary

This episode of "3 Wow and 1 Promise" reveals a bigger picture behind Sam Altman's recent moves - he's not just building digital superintelligence, he's building a cyber-physical ecosystem. Ksenia analyzes Altman's "Gentle Singularity" blog post and connects the dots: OpenAI's $6.5 billion acquisition of Jony Ive's hardware startup IO, the return to robotics research, and investments in 1x Technology and Figure AI all point to a unified vision where LLMs (the brain), wearables (the sensors), and robots (the embodiment) merge into true singularity.

The second wow covers Jensen Huang's $50 trillion vision for physical AI - autonomous cars, humanoid robots, and self-replicating factories - with Nvidia predicting this becomes reality in 2026-2027. The third wow highlights Multiverse Computing, a Spanish company that can shrink AI models by 90% without losing performance, enabling LLMs to run on phones and wearables - a critical enabler for the cyber-physical vision.

The promise section covers Tesla's Optimus robot, which despite impressive demos faces challenges: head of robotics Milan Kovachevich stepped down while Elon Musk promised 5,000 robots by year-end, plus China's rare earth export restrictions threaten production.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=0s) We all know that Sam Altman and OpenAI are very interested in achieving super intelligence and singularity. What is it really about?

[0:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=16s) Last week, Sam Altman published a fascinating article under the name "The Gentle Singularity." Just listen to the first sentence. "We are past the event horizon. The takeoff has started. Humanity is close to building digital super intelligence." And it's going for a couple of pages but let's stop here and just say that Sam Altman is not interested in only digital super intelligence. What he plans is much bigger and this particular article tells us about that.

[0:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=49s) I analyzed what are the words that he uses the most and the four most used nouns are people, AI, progress, and robots. So, let's just connect the dots.

[1:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=62s) OpenAI recently acquired Jony Ive's hardware startup IO for crazy six or even $6.5 billion. Jony Ive is famous for creating the iconic design of iPhone and working along with Steve Jobs. Everyone started to talk about wearables that OpenAI is going to produce with Jony Ive. Sure, maybe. Yes, we don't know yet.

[1:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=88s) Another thing that OpenAI is doing is getting back into robotics. Initially when OpenAI was a research lab that not that many people knew about, they were very interested in robotics. They were one of the first to experimenting with robotic arms and they published some good research about that. It was back in the years at some point they closed the robotic department. Now they're back.

[1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=110s) OpenAI startup fund is backing 1x Technology. That's a robotic company. They also backing Figure AI, also a company that builds general purpose humanoid robots. They might be even acquiring them in the nearest future.

[2:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=127s) It gives us this bigger, much bigger view of what actually Sam Altman and OpenAI are going to build. In my opinion, what is actually happening is that OpenAI's LLM, the brain, OpenAI's wearables that they're going to build, and the robotic systems are going to be connected and are going to create this cyber-physical ecosystem which will become a true singularity moment in this embodied super intelligence.

[2:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=156s) I would argue that wearables are just the sensor actuator layer between humans and robots in the path toward the singularity. And I think this article that Sam Altman published and that everybody discusses in terms of achieved superhuman intelligence that machines have is actually about this moment of creation of cyber-physical ecosystem.

[3:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=181s) Wearables will allow humans stay relevant and participatory in an accelerating intelligence environment. Robots are the embodied counterpart and they also need this data. There is not enough physical data sets for robots to learn. So wearables connected to humans will become this channel to robots to learn more together.

[3:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=203s) All these things are about this cyber-physical ecosystem where the singularity isn't just a sudden break. It's this gradual merger of all systems together and Sam Altman needs Jony Ive to make us fall in love with our devices, be it wearables or robots, the way we did fall in love with iPhones.

[3:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=224s) And I will give you another wow news from the last week that supports this vision. By the way, if you're new on this channel, my name is Ksenia. I'm writing Turing Post, the newsletter about the past, present, and future of AI and machine learning and how we're going to deal with that. In this digest, three wow and one promise, I tell you about the news that made me say wow and one thing that is very promising but not there yet.

[4:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=252s) To the second wow news from the last week that confirmed the vision published by Sam Altman. Jensen Huang, who you always want to follow and see what he thinks about the future, dropped a huge number. He unveiled a $50 trillion vision about physical AI.

[4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=270s) While physical AI is not new per se, Nvidia speaks a lot about it. We've covered it a lot. It is now become a bigger picture with OpenAI, with Nvidia, with other companies joining. We now see that this market that Nvidia CEO thinks will be $50 trillion worth is about autonomous cars, humanoid robots, and self-replicating factories and all other stuff included in this physical AI.

[4:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=297s) And the craziest part, the wow part about it is that it's very close, maybe in 2026 and 2027.

[5:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=306s) And now I'll give you the third news that might... It's not about physical AI. It's more about the wearables that we were talking about in the beginning. But I'm talking about Spanish company Multiverse Computing. They just dropped the bombshell.

[5:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=318s) They raised a round to shrink massive AI models by up to 90% without losing performance. Just imagine how crazy is that? That means that LLMs that fit on smaller devices, think phones, think wearables, right? And it will run faster and much much much cheaper, up to 80% cheaper. It's mind-blowing.

[5:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=349s) 3 years ago, we had these very nascent generative AI. Then we had this massive large language models that suddenly started to create amazing things. And now we go into this world of models that can be shrunk without losing performance and that will be on every device that we use which makes it again possible to put them on wearables.

[6:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=373s) Wearables will send the data to robots. People, AI, progress, robots, cyber-physical ecosystem.

[6:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=385s) And the last thing in my digest, the promising project that might not be there yet for the party, it's Tesla's Optimus. Tesla's Optimus robot is amazing. The demo is sleek, smooth, it looks great. But last week we got some bad news for Elon Musk. I mean not we got him bad news, he got it himself.

[6:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=406s) But the news are that his head of robotics Milan Kovachevich has stepped down while Elon Musk promised to build 5,000 robots by the end of this year. This is tough. Tesla's ambitious Optimus project just might hit a wall.

[7:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=422s) Of course, there is another person working on it. It's Ashok Elluswami who is autopilot lead. He's at the helm steering the team. It might really put the project at risk because it's very ambitious. It needs speed. It needs resources. It needs team. The team faces major challenges ahead.

[7:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=442s) Not only human quitting the project, but also including China's restrictions on rare earth exports critical to robot production.

[7:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=452s) It's amazing to see how this week all is around robotics, all is around physical AI, all is about this big vision about cyber-physical ecosystem.

[7:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=463s) I assure you Sam Altman is building an empire that does not only include ChatGPT or LLM as brain. He wants to have his fingers, his minds, his people and build the whole ecosystem of this cyber-physical singularity.

[8:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=482s) Isn't it fascinating? I do believe with this connection, human AI progress robots, we will achieve the moment when we can actually be much more creative and spend time on what we want to do. And a lot of that would be actually physical work that we want to do.

[8:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAJ4D8RAyfY&t=495s) And the other stuff, picking up clothes, putting dish into the dishwasher, working in the factories, cleaning the street, that will be on robots. That's crazy how fast we're going there.
