# Smoke 2 by Google DeepMind Genie 2

## Summary

This is a brief 5-second demo video showcasing smoke simulation effects generated by Google DeepMind's Genie 2, an AI model capable of generating interactive 3D environments from single images. The video demonstrates the realistic physics and visual quality of smoke rendering within AI-generated worlds.

Genie 2 was announced by DeepMind as a foundation world model that can generate an endless variety of action-controllable, playable 3D environments for training and evaluating embodied agents. This clip appears to be one of several short demonstrations of the model's capabilities in simulating realistic physical phenomena.
