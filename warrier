use the youtube skill to get a list of the recent mkbhd videos, say the latest 30 of them.  Then make an info markdownf ile for each of then (use a 
  parallel agent) that pulls does the transcript, and gives s high level summary, and then key points (with links to where its mentioned in the       
  video) and then some of the most surprisig quotes (also with links.)  Have the video meta data in it the front matter.  Then build an overall       
  indexd page for that channel with an index of what was taked about (also with timestamp links) and any interesting stats.  We'll want to do this    
  for other channels so have it all under the channel directory.  Lets first try it with a few videos and then tweak the process
