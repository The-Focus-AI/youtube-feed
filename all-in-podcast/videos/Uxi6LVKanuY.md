# OpenAI's Code Red, Sacks vs New York Times, New Poverty Line?

## Summary

This episode of the All-In Podcast covers three major topics. First, the hosts discuss Sam Altman's "Code Red" memo at OpenAI, where he told employees to stop working on side projects and focus on improving ChatGPT. The competition in AI has intensified dramatically, with Anthropic beating OpenAI in enterprise revenue, Google's Gemini gaining significant market share (now at 14-15%), and multiple players like xAI, Meta, and others leapfrogging each other on benchmarks. The hosts debate whether OpenAI can maintain its lead or if the market will fragment into a three or four-way race.

The second segment addresses a New York Times article that accused David Sacks of benefiting himself and his friends through his role as White House AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks vigorously defends himself, explaining that he actually divested hundreds of millions of dollars in positions at substantial personal cost (including selling private assets at 50% discounts) to avoid any conflicts of interest. The hosts characterize the article as a hit piece designed to intimidate successful people from serving in government.

The final segment examines a viral claim that the U.S. poverty line should be $140,000 instead of $31,000 when factoring in modern costs like childcare. Chamath analyzes the data and finds the claim was based on high-cost areas like New York suburbs, while more typical cities show a required income around $93,000 for a family of four. This leads to a broader discussion about wealth taxes being proposed in California, Washington, and other states, and the hosts' concerns about a "slow descent into socialism."

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=0s) All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, the AllIn podcast. In the news, in your feed. We're ready to go. We've got the original quartet here. The band's back together.

[0:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=16s) All right. First up on the docket. A code red has been called by Sam Altman. He sent a memo on Monday. He told employees to stop working on side quests, you know, like ads, etc., and focus on the core chat. GPT, the core experience. Make it faster. Make it better. And I think we all know why because Gemini and Grok and Claude from Anthropic have been crushing it. Chat GPT5, let's call it what it is, was a bit of a flop. It didn't perform to expectations. We discussed that a couple of weeks ago or months ago. Anthropic is beating OpenAI in enterprise revenue starting this summer. And I talked about how, you know, previous episodes on the streets. I'm seeing more startups want to use Anthropic API and also Google Gemini's API and they don't essentially trust Open AI to not steal their business.

[1:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=72s) So, it's big changes right now. Here is a chart based on data from July. Most of Anthropic's revenue here is corporate. Most of OpenAI's as everybody knows is consumer. And here's another chart. OpenAI's new infrastructure deals versus revenue and this is just for 2025 alone. A lot of deals being made, but competition is fierce. Chamath, your thoughts here on the game on the field. Code red for people who don't know in our industry is when everybody reports to the office and gets focused on one thing. And that's apparently what Sam's doing. How do you interpret it?

[1:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=108s) Look, I think that there are two things. Let's do the strategic lens and then the tactical lens. The strategic lens is that this is an incredibly vibrant and dynamic market and I think it's too difficult and too early to pick winners other than at the silicon layer where largely that die has been cast. I think that it's going to grow. So we can talk about how there'll be more competition but it's roughly Nvidia plus AMD plus Google plus a bunch of inference silicon. So that's sort of that market but above it at the model market. It reminds me, frankly, a lot of when we were building Facebook. I remember sitting around our senior executive team, six of us, looking at MySpace, who was an order of magnitude bigger than us. And at some point, we were like, you know what, our product is just fundamentally better than theirs. And they had 100 million plus users and we had sort of 15. But we knew that we were eventually going to beat them. Nobody else knew.

[2:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=167s) And I feel like this market is similarly evolving, which is that you have these early winners, but there's still so much work to do. There's still so many consumer expectations to define that it's too early to know who's going to win. And ultimately, what we are learning, especially as all these markets converge, is that distribution still matters a ton, which favors Google. It favors Meta, although Meta's quite behind. And now it will still favor OpenAI because they have 800 million monthly actives.

[3:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=196s) So then the tactical thing is what do you do knowing that this dynamic is set up to have a lot of competition and I think what you have to do is streamline the focus and try to make a crisis out of every opportunity because look the companies tend to just grow this positive entropy tends to cause people to hire at every level and you look around and there's thousands of people that you didn't know even six months ago. And so I think if Sam can use different points in time to tighten the core focus, they'll be better off.

[3:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=230s) And I think that is what Google did a while back. If you remember the whole black George Washington thing, they were able to use that as a rallying cry to streamline the organization and to focus and to get their best and smartest people to work on the most highly leveraged tasks. And what you see now is an incredible overperformance from where they were. I've said this before, but Gemini is incredible. So, I think that that's what's happening. Too early to call. It's a three or four horse race and Sam needs to batten down the hatches. And I think he used this opportunity to stop a bunch of peripheral activities.

[4:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=260s) Yeah. And as we saw, Sergey called a personal code red. He said, "I have to get in the office. I have to inspire everybody because this is existential for us if we lose the search franchise, which they haven't. The code red works." So David Friedberg, maybe you could discuss a little bit code red as a management technique. You were at Google. I don't know if they were calling code reds back then because you didn't have any competition, but we're in a much different world here. This is the most competitive thing we've ever seen in our lifetimes.

[4:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=290s) I think Google had an early lead in search and then Microsoft launched and it formed a code red model at Google that was called Project Canada as the code word for Microsoft. And there was a weekly war room meeting and a whole bunch of strategy and product decision-making that was driven around the impending threat from Microsoft because Microsoft was such a big behemoth, so well capitalized, had incredible engineering talent. Part of the response was to set up an office in Kirkland to recruit engineers up in Seattle to aggressively grow that base. There was a whole bunch of tactics that emerged from the strategic lens of project Canada.

[5:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=330s) It is a very powerful method. It is how the United States got to the moon in a race with Russia. It is how we are now in a race for supremacy in technology and AI against China. Having an impending threat is a very strong motivational tactic. It is a very focusing setting and it drives innovation. And so we'll see what happens. Chat GPT was basically the market monopoly in AI or LLM chat interface and it only had one way to go which was down. Google I think at this point has roughly 14%. So here you can see OpenAI is on the decline. Obviously a little over a year ago they were at 90% plus market share in generative AI traffic and today Gemini is at 14-15%. The depth, the flywheel that Google has built gives them such extraordinary advantage.

[6:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=384s) Okay, let's go to Emperor Palpatine. This is coming together exactly as you orchestrated, you as the czar of AI and crypto. Thank you for your service, civil servant David Sacks. You wanted to see vibrant competition. Well, here we have it. Assess the playing field as you see it from DC.

[6:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=403s) Well, first of all, let me give credit to Sam for calling this code red, breaking the glass, and pulling the alarm. I think it's so easy for CEOs in general to engage in happy talk and ignore problems, especially when discussing them is going to create a PR story that they don't like. And I do think one of the things that's unique about Silicon Valley is just that the founders and CEOs do treat the situation of their companies in a more existential way because we actually do have tremendous competition.

[7:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=435s) And so anytime I think a CEO is willing to again take a bad PR story in order to focus their troops on a real business problem, I think they deserve credit for it because I think when you look at the rest of the Fortune 500, you know, these CEOs are just kind of managing PR all the time. Now with respect to the ecosystem as a whole, it is very competitive and I think we've got five major companies and they all have their strengths.

[7:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=462s) So ChatGPT is the leader in consumer. They have something like 80% market share in consumer use of LLM chatbots. But then Google came out with their new Gemini 3 and they were starting to take share based on the strength of Gemini 3 and the integration it has obviously within Google search because it's very easy for people to discover it when they do a Google search and now they're seeing that it's actually pretty good. So they were starting to take share from ChatGPT and I think that's why Sam issued the code red.

[8:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=490s) Then you've got Anthropic like you mentioned where I don't particularly love what I've called their regulatory capture strategy, but I have to acknowledge their products are very good. Everybody seems to say that they have the best coding assistant and they're carving out a very lucrative niche in enterprise. And then you've got xAI which I think is the best at current events because of the integration with X. And also Elon seems to be able to scale his data center, his training cluster the fastest. He's got Colossus one, now he's got Colossus 2, and that portends good things for Grok 5. He's going to be trained on the largest cluster of Blackwells.

[8:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=530s) So, in any event, you got all these companies that are doing pretty well. I guess Meta has sort of hit some headwinds, but they're going to continue investing tremendously in AI and they've got deep pockets to do it. So, I think that they'll come back. And you know what you see is all these companies are kind of leapfrogging each other. You get a new version and then they sort of leapfrog each other in terms of the leaderboards.

[9:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=555s) Yes, Sacks, when you look at the leaderboard it's constantly Grok comes above Gemini, Gemini comes... There's a lot of leapfrogging going on. There's a lot of also I'd say specialization now going on in the ways that I just mentioned. All these companies are developing strengths, there's sort of verticals happening. And so I've described this as sort of a Goldilocks scenario where you're making a lot of progress in AI but the market is remaining very competitive. Ideally it does not consolidate just to one monopoly player like we've seen in other tech markets because then you end up with a big tech company that's got too much power and control. That's not generally a great thing for consumers.

[9:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=595s) Versus China. What does it say versus us versus China? That was the dialogue a year ago. Oh my god, China. Oh my god, China. Where are we at today? Because this is impressive, this vibrant competition. Well, look, competition brings out the best in the American system. And I think that that is what creates the most progress and that's what's going to allow us to win the AI race against China. China has a lot of competition too, but they do tend to anoint national champions more. I guess they usually do it more after a competition stage. So, you know, maybe it doesn't prevent competition, but look, China's formidable. They got a lot of good AI companies, too. And this is going to be a horse race, but again, there's no question that in the American system, it's competition that brings out the best. And that's what we're seeing right now.

[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=645s) Jason, what do you think? Interestingly, I just want to build a little bit on what Friedberg showed. The way I'm sort of seeing this is now ChatGPT versus the world. 36 months ago, ChatGPT, OpenAI had 100%, right? They started the category as you pointed out correctly, David. And their decline in market share is increasing in velocity. If we were looking at just 12 months ago, they had 84% of the space and now they're at 68. So they've... this is accelerating.

[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=675s) You pointed out Chamath correctly why it's accelerating. Distribution matters. We've talked about it countless times here. Meta is forcing you to use their AI search, which is pretty bad. I'll be honest. Every time you do a search on Instagram, it's annoying. But those all count as users using the product just like Slack faced competition from Microsoft Teams when it bundled.

[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=700s) And so I just tracked this out and this is what I think is going to happen over the next four years. I think we're going to see OpenAI go down to about a third of the market and I think the other players are going to take two-thirds. The reason I think this is because to Sacks's point, specialization's happening. If you look at Nano Banana, which is the image processing over at Google, it's fantastic. Grok image is fantastic. So, you're going to have four or five different choices for images. You're going to have four or five different really credible choices.

[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=730s) Now, you have to look also at the competition and what Sam is facing. I've known Sam 20 years now. He is a consummate dealmaker, perhaps too good at dealmaking. He was incredible at recruiting and his PR game was very strong. Everybody realizes that. And look at who he's facing: Friedberg, Elon, Sergey and Sundar at Google, Zuckerberg at Meta, Dario, Satya at Microsoft who's his partner who's now his competitor. Elon was his benefactor, now his competitor. You got the open-source projects, DeepSeek, etc. Sacks in China.

[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=770s) And then his former employees are trying to kill him as well. So you have Ilya doing Safe Super Intelligence which hasn't launched yet and Mira doing Thinking Machine. She was obviously doing all the video stuff. So I think what we're going to see here if we're sitting here, I don't know, next year, they're going to be in the next 12 to 24 months under 50%. And these companies are explicitly trying to kill OpenAI. The amount of bad will that Sam has built is colossal and I think it's from doing too many deals.

[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=805s) And if you look at what he did to Nvidia, Nvidia put out a statement recently that they have the option to invest. So we were sitting here two months ago and I know people in the industry were staying up late at night worrying about all these deals Sam was doing. All those deals apparently are coming out that they're options. These weren't real deals. A lot of them were options. And so Jensen came out and said, "Hey, we have the opportunity to invest in OpenAI." But you remember Sam did that AMD deal the week after he or two weeks after he did the OpenAI deal. A lot of this is creating bad feelings.

[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=840s) And I think we're at peak OpenAI right now. I said it on the show a couple weeks ago. I think the pair trade is to bet against... it's ChatGPT versus the world. And I think the world wins two-thirds. They can still be in a good place. I think you're right that this market probably gets split up three or four ways. And so the winner probably gets a third of the market. Most other markets that end up in a three or four person race ends up in that space. But a third of a market can still be very valuable if that market has five or six billion people using it. Absolutely. It's going to be tremendous. Yeah. And that can still support a multi-trillion dollar market cap.

[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=885s) So I don't think it's by any means a death knell for OpenAI, but it does mean that a lot of these projects probably need to get shuttered because you need to just do a few things very, very well because consumers will start to split their purchasing decisions if you will or their usage decisions across vertical things for specific purposes. So yes, I may use Grok image because I love that and it's just much better. But then I may use Anthropic for codegen while I use Gemini for deep research and then I use ChatGPT for conversational search. Now all of a sudden I'm using all four. That's highly realistic, that outcome.

[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=920s) In fact, I look at my phone now. I try to limit the number of apps on the phone, but I have Gemini and Grok as the two anchor apps. Because I'm so reliant on both of them and I just keep going back and forth between them. Interestingly, I have four. I have Claude also and Perplexity on my desktop. And I go through all four of them.

[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=945s) Here's what Google and other folks are planning. They're going to take the main revenue stream of OpenAI and they're going to suck the oxygen out of the room and they're going to try to strangle Sam and the team over there by making it free. So, right now, if 75% of that... very, very vital, but this is war. This is the greatest battle we've seen since like Netscape versus Microsoft and the internet. They're going to make Gemini free for life for the best models. That's my prediction for Google and I think Meta will be right behind them. Why? They have the ad network already built and they know in that fierce competition which you were part of Chamath and Friedberg how fierce that competition was. That duopoly does not want to become a triopoly with Sam.

[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=990s) I think this is going to be very analogous to what happened with Netscape. People used to pay 50 bucks for a Netscape browser and then the idea when Microsoft came in and made it free and Chrome became free and Dolphin browser and a million other providers. Same thing's going to happen to ChatGPT. Right now 80% of the revenue comes from $20 subscriptions. That's going to get decimated to zero. I don't think consumers are going to pay for this product just like they won't pay for search and they won't pay for a browser because Google and Meta will make it free.

[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1020s) I think it's different reason actually. The reason why they will do it is because they have such an inordinate amount of cash and that cash is valueless on the balance sheet. So, you might as well just rip it in. If you look at the companies that have a need to spend money right now, it's Google, it's Microsoft, it's Meta, it's Nvidia, and maybe Broadcom, but let's just keep Broadcom out of it. But Apple's there, too. And Apple. Yeah. All of those companies have so much cash. If you actually look at the DCF of the enterprise value of these businesses, it gets very little credit for that cash almost to the point where it's worthless.

[17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1060s) And so you either need to spend it on M&A, spend it on buybacks, or spend it to subsidize a product so that you can maintain your leadership in the broader market. And so what you're going to see is these big companies do this capital allocation model in a much more aggressive way. So there's only so many share buybacks that these guys can do. They approve 50, 60, 70, 80 billion dollars in buybacks. It just doesn't lift the stock price the same way it does when you actually show leadership in a product category.

[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1090s) So to your point, if you're just going to underwrite a decision, just look at the last 3 weeks of Google's stock performance, it basically doubled once we thought that Gemini was incredible. And so if you want to make Gemini even more incredible, just get, pour another billion users into it. And if that cost you 50 billion, it's okay because you'll make a trillion of market cap. It's like a no-brainer. Yeah. And think about all the reinforcement learning that those big players have at scale.

[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1125s) By the way, the other thing is if we're playing conspiracy theorist, I think the reason why Sam did those deals to your point, he is a consummate, very talented dealmaker. Yes. Is probably because he needed to continue to generate the type of momentum required to raise the quantum of capital that he needs. So if you're silent, it's much harder to raise a hundred billion dollars and you're shucking and jiving and you're just putting a lot of things out there that could convince people that there's a level of momentum that's worth underwriting at a much higher valuation. So you have to keep that in mind, too.

[19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1160s) Yes, I think that that is his high-level, you know, 4D chess. I think Nvidia is predicting it now. I think Nvidia is not going to take their option to invest in OpenAI or they're going to really downgrade it 70-80% and they're going to allocate it to other players. Friedberg, any final thoughts here as we wrap up on this? What is your basis for that prediction? I think that Nvidia wants to own more of the other players. I do actually have a basis for this. I think that they were very pissed off at the other support he gave to their competitors. How do you know they closed that deal? I know a lot of people in the industry. You sound like the New York Times. Okay. Well, great segue.

[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1200s) Everybody knows. What's your source? Everybody... reveal my sources say... sources say... open secret. Sources say... sorry. I'll just... let me just wrap up on the... and I'll just echo a little bit what Jim said. I don't think that the battle is going to be won and lost on LLMs. I think that there's several fronts and we're so early in AI. It's not going to necessarily just be about text-based token production.

[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1230s) These non-text-based models, the non-LLM models, the complexity to them and the differentiation is so much wider than it is in LLM. Kind of think about it in terms of like a Hold'em versus Omaha game. Like the difference between the median and the best player in an Omaha game is so significant compared to the median and the best player in a Hold'em game because it's just so much more complex. I don't know if you remember this guy Chris Ferguson. He used to win every Omaha tournament back in the day because he was one of the first guys to figure it out. So everyone that knew Hold'em thought that they could just step into Omaha and because he figured out how to do Omaha, he just wrecked everyone consistently.

[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1270s) Anyway, in video for example, right, they use diffusion models and then they also use a transformer architecture and then they use these convolutional neural networks to create structure within the frame and continue structure between frames and video. There are multiple models that have to interact and work together to render video. So you have to have good training. You also have to have unique architecture. And so the amount of differentiation that's possible in video AI is I would say at this point today so much wider than the differentiation in text-based AI like what we see with LLMs.

[21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1305s) As those things start to become more mainstream, I think that applications that we are not necessarily thinking about today are going to become a bigger use case for how we spend our time. And that is really when you'll start to see, you know, this horse race start to kind of play out a little bit more differently than it does today where everything's all about usage on a chat interface. We're going to look back at that one day. It's going to be the equivalent of everyone on AOL Instant Messenger or Yahoo Instant Messenger. It's like, who gives a shit? That's not really where the game's going to be played.

[22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1335s) While we're speaking, Gemini just released Gemini 3. Deep Think is here. So, the race is continuing even as we're taping the show. Let me add one more thing which is I don't know just a few months ago on this show maybe it was three months ago maybe it was six months ago we were all like giving eulogies for Google. I wasn't. I was not. I took the other side. Well I mean I don't know there are a lot of people were and I was definitely... I think the majority of the industry was. I did take the other side of it yeah.

[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1365s) I think Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley were... The Bragley show... Bragley show... it's one person... Brad Gurley definitely were and look and the argument made a lot of sense which was this, which is even if you believe that Google's going to come back and have a credible AI product, remember they were caught completely flat-footed by this. They figured out the transformer architecture back in 2017, but then they didn't really do anything with it and then OpenAI grabbed on to that and then like you showed on that chart, they basically had a 2-year head start on LLMs.

[23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1395s) So, a lot of people were basically saying that this was it for Google because obviously LLMs are so much better at web search than the 10 blue links. And moreover, for monetization, why would you need to have, you know, ad links or paid links in an LLM world? And I think the point that Brad and Bill were making is again, even if Google catches up, they'll never have the dominant position in AI that they have in search. It still might be true. Who knows? But the point is just everyone was saying that Google was in deep trouble just I don't know 6 months ago and then like you said I think Sergey came back and that gave them a major shot in the arm and they got more focused and now they've launched what appears to be the best or one of the best models. A competitive... but look these other companies there's a lot of leapfrogging going on.

[24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1440s) I think really importantly it's not just about Sergey coming back, it's about giving themselves permission to take risk. The reason Google didn't lean into AI for years, even though they had the technology Sacks, is because they were nervous about cannibalization to search, they were nervous about the quality of the product. They didn't want to release things too early. And then they changed their posture and they became a more risk-taking posture. And that gave them the permission to run, which by the way, I would argue is the opposite at OpenAI in the last couple months.

[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1470s) I used to use advanced voice on ChatGPT all the time. I cannot stand it anymore. I do not use it. It has basically hedged away all of the value because it tries to be polite. It tries to make sure that it's giving you warnings all the time. It doesn't want to give you data because it's scared that it might give you the wrong data. You can see it used to give you data all the time. I cannot get it to give me numbers anymore. I'm like, give me the numbers and it just says these kind of high-level arching statements and I'm like that's not what I want. I went over to Gemini. It gave me the numbers.

[25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1500s) And I think that Google's willingness to take risk has really kind of highlighted the difference in posture in the last year. ChatGPT is now acting and OpenAI has been acting like an incumbent, fearful of losing market share and fearful of getting attacked in the media and attacked by consumers for saying the wrong thing. And so they've taken this kind of defensive posture that I think has fundamentally damaged the product and the brand. And the opposite was happening at Google at the same time, which is Larry, Sergey, and Sundar being given permission by the board to take risk, to go hard, to figure this out. And boom. You know, it's amazing how the horse race has changed.

[25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1540s) I'm just having a great time thinking about... I'm thinking about Friedberg yelling at his AI assistant in his car. It's like we need to make a short out of that. Keep going. Well, just Google did one other important thing. I mean, in addition to Sergey, there was putting Demis Hassabis in charge of all of AI because before I think he was just in charge of Google DeepMind, it was sort of a subset and then they put him in charge of the overall and I think that made a huge difference as well. Yeah. And the pie is growing. So, the number of searches, the number of queries is increasing dramatically. I think we'll have 20-30 times the amount of queries being done because the answers are better.

[26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1575s) It's not just queries. It's not just queries. This is my point. It's like more than... you're not using it to do search anymore, right? You're using it to watch video. You're using it to book flights. Yeah. The agentic stuff. I'm putting that all together. So, the amount of utility that you can get from it is so great that it's going to go 20x. The same thing's happening with ride sharing. It's more than just search is the whole point. This has now become such an instrumental part of everything we do in our lives and it's going to take over more of how we spend our time in our lives that it's not just about search anymore. It's a whole new paradigm. The pie will be 20 times bigger.

[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1610s) Let me ask you a very question. Do you think that OpenAI's sort of more conservative risk posture, do you think it's a function of the fact that whether by luck or design they decided that the consumer market was sort of their core market? Whereas you look at something like Anthropic, right, and they've carved out enterprise, but if you're a consumer product, there's so many more things you have to address and you're going to be attacked at so many more different ways.

[27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1635s) Yeah. And by being the market incumbent, it actually ended up creating a fantastic foil for Google because they started getting all of the arrows and slings from the media about health advice and suicides and hallucinations and sending wrong information and all the risks and damage that that causes. Meanwhile, everyone's just laughing and joking about Google and ignoring them. It was more than that. Remember, remember last summer there was the court case where the judge said that they were guilty of having the monopoly and then he was going to rule on what the remedies were going to be. And I think that was in what was it September and the judge said that during the summer and then whenever it was that he ruled on the remedy that they were existentially threatened in their search business and so everything had changed.

[28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1680s) Yeah. I mean so the company didn't get broken out. Remember they were thinking about whether to spin out Chrome, YouTube. Yeah. All these kind of... in a way no greater blessing has ever happened to Alphabet than OpenAI's rise. And I think that that rise not only did it create the foil for Google in the monopoly sense, but it also took the attention away from Google, focused it on OpenAI, and that attention fundamentally damaged OpenAI's strategic product capabilities because they had to start to be so much more careful about what they said, how they said it. And it fundamentally damaged the product. And the opposite was happening at Google at the same time, which is Larry, Sergey, and Sundar being given permission by the board to take risk, to go hard, to figure this out. And boom. You know, it's amazing how the horse race has changed.

[28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1725s) Okay, we had an amazing time in Vegas. I want to thank our friends at the Venetian. You guys were the best host we could have ever imagined. What VIP treatment you gave the besties and our friends and partners. And we had a great interview with Molly Bloom from Molly's Game, the movie, etc. Thanks to our partners, Oracle, OKX, and the New York Stock Exchange for partnering with us on a very successful F1 weekend in Vegas. And we had a great lunch with Oracle. Congrats to them on Red Bull's Big Win in Vegas and an amazing dinner with OKX where my new bestie, Jose Andres, the chef, came from Bazaar Meats and he cooked for us. He hung out with us. He played a little cards with us. He's just a true gentleman and a mensch. Looking forward to hanging out with Jose Andres a little more in the future.

[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1770s) All right, there's another thing that went on this weekend. Big tech story and at the risk of being a little navel gazing here. We're going to cover it. The New York Times versus Mr. David Sacks. On Sunday, the New York Times published an article titled "Silicon Valley's Man in the White House is Benefiting Himself and His Friends." Sacks are obviously the man they're referring to. Five reporters worked on this story for approximately 5 months is what we hear and the story attempted to frame you Sacks as conflicted. First, that your firm Craft has investments in companies.

[30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1805s) New York Times key claim quote: "Mr. Sacks has positioned himself to personally benefit. He has 78 tech investments including at least 449 stakes in companies with ties to artificial intelligence." And for background, Sacks, Elon, you all joined as special government employees, SGEs. These are different than cabinet members in a bunch of different ways. Basically, they can't work more than 130 days. They're allowed to split time between their day jobs and DC. They don't have to be approved by the Senate. And they provide special expertise as Mr. Sacks is doing as the czar of crypto and AI.

[30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1845s) Second major claim, raising the profile of AllIn. Quote: "Mr. Sacks has raised the profile of his weekly podcast, All In, through his government role and expanded the business," which is super hilarious because they think our traffic peaked right before the election. But Sacks, obviously you got a ton of air cover. People thought the story was biased and a hit job and it fell pretty flat. What's your take on this? Maybe take us behind the story.

[31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1875s) Well, I think maybe a good place to start is with the reaction to it. Like you said, there was this huge outpouring of people in Silicon Valley who reacted in a way that showed that they understood that this story was a hit piece, that it was biased, and I'd say most importantly, it didn't even live up to its own headline. It didn't prove the thing that they were asserting in the headline. And so, everyone could just see on its face that it was a hatchet job. And so, everyone started reacting that way. And it was nice to kind of get that outpouring of support from so many different people in Silicon Valley, including many of the companies who we just talked about are so vigorously competing with each other. I mean, I think this might be the only thing that Sam and Elon have agreed on in the last year.

[32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1920s) Yeah. Didn't you tell everyone to put these tweets out? I mean, like... So that was sort of the next, that was the next big lie that the media tried to perpetrate was somehow that this response was coordinated by me. No. And the reality... by the way, was crazy because you told me explicitly, "Stand down. I don't need you to do it." And I was like, "Leroy Jenkins." And I just went in and I was like, "I'm tweeting about this bullshit."

[32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1950s) No, I never told anyone to do anything except for you guys. And I told you guys not to react to it because I didn't want to Streisand the story, you know, where you basically draw even more attention to it. That was my media plan. And then what happened is the story just went viral anyway because all of Silicon Valley reacted on their own in a grassroots and authentic way because I think they were actually genuinely offended by how bad the story was, how ridiculous it was on its face. And so they react and then that became the story. And so this whole coordinated narrative became in a way part of the media industry's cover up for itself like their attempt to explain away why everybody thought that the story was so bad.

[33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=1990s) Let me just say I do think that this outpouring of support does illustrate something important which is just how much power and respect the New York Times has lost. You know 10 years ago if the New York Times ran a hit piece on somebody even if other people didn't like it they wouldn't want to say anything because they'd be afraid that they would be the next target. And that mystique and that fear has completely broken down. People can kind of see the New York Times for what it is, which is basically a bunch of political activists who are pretending to be reporters and essentially they just launder the point of view of their anonymous sources who are basically left-wing Democrats and try to portray those viewpoints as somehow being neutral or objective truth, right? Because they're kind of presenting themselves as these neutral arbiters of the truth. And I think everyone can kind of see through that sham at this point.

[34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2040s) Yes. The thing they started with was the headline. And that was the one thing they refused to change no matter how many times we refuted their narrative. You know what they would do is every couple weeks they'd send us a new fact check. And we would basically debunk it. And we can show you some of those fact checks if you want to see them to see where the story started and what they're trying to prove. Yeah, let's do that. I think audience would really... and what would happen is every time we would debunk one of their accusations, they would just come back to us with a new one every couple of weeks. The only fixed point in their reporting was this idea that I had to have these conflicts of interests that were benefiting myself.

[34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2080s) Let me ask you a question. So, one of the statements that was made and then Governor Newsom repeated it at Andrew Ross Sorkin's Dealbook Conference yesterday is that you did not put all of your investments into a blind trust. You should have done that is what Newsom said on stage. Can you just address that like and what actions you actually took when you chose to take the office? What were you legally required to take and maybe why you didn't do a blind trust or maybe you did? I don't know.

[35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2115s) Well, no, we looked at that. Sorry, Sacks. Just give me a second. I just want to say this because you're not going to say this yourself, but I remember when you were going through this, you were so concerned about the perception of a conflict of interest that you took such extraordinary measures about the degree at which you were selling things and getting rid of things to make sure that you could do the job cleanly and wholly. I watched you do this and I watched you do something that I thought was so over the top. I'm like, "Holy shit, you really are doing this for the country." And I was so shocked and surprised by it. And I just want to say that because I've observed it and they still came out with this piece which was so shocking to me given what you did.

[36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2160s) So you guys know what I went through because I was LPs in some of your funds and you know that I divested them which you could argue was above and beyond the call of duty, but I was just trying to avoid any potential conflict. And that I think is the central lie of this piece. Not only is the piece not true, it's the anti-truth. Yeah. Because the truth is that I divested hundreds of millions of dollars of positions in promising technology ventures at a substantial cost to my net worth. So not only is this job not benefiting me, it's actually cost me a lot of money to serve, but I did it because it's an honor to be asked by the president to serve and it's something I wanted to do and I thought I can make a difference. So the whole premise here is just false. And the New York Times through its 5 months of investigations knew this, but they just refused to budge on the premise of their story.

[36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2210s) Now, to your question here, if you look at one of the key paragraphs that Jason, you mentioned is when they try to mention that I have 449 investments tied to AI. And they say their investigation uncovered this and some of their reporters on podcasts have tried to portray themselves as Woodward and Bernstein here having uncovered... How did they get this crazy list of companies? I wonder. I disclosed them. They didn't uncover them. I disclosed them. They're in my... available to everyone. They're on the White House website in my ethics letter.

[37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2245s) So, every government employee, whether you're a full-time or SGE, files disclosures with the government and my ethics letters basically contained these pages and pages of all these different positions. Now in that ethics letter they said that I had divested, I had initiated or completed divestment of over 99% of the positions that could pose a conflict for AI and it's in there and this is where I think you know again they were very deceptive is it was the OGE, the Office of Government Ethics, the career civil servants, the lawyers, the accountants at OGE who approved that letter and all the contents of that letter, who reviewed all those disclosures and they're the ones who concluded that I did not have any conflicts. So really what the New York Times' beef is with the career civil servants at OGE.

[38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2290s) Maybe walk us through what you actually did do. Why didn't you do the blind trust and help us get the context there. So on the blind trust. So it's kind of funny. One of the New York Times reporters was talking about this on a podcast which is where I think Newsom picked it up from. My ethics lawyer who teaches a course on conflicts of interest at Harvard said that that reporter should really take his course because he would actually learn something about the conflicts laws. The blind trust idea is rarely used and in my case it would not have worked because I have minor children. You can only use the blind trust to have your kids be beneficiaries if they're adults. That's the way the conflict laws work. So it just wasn't even applicable in my case.

[38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2335s) And what I did instead of creating a blind trust is I divested the positions that were a conflict at a discount to their fair market value in the case of my LP interest in all these funds. I divested almost a hundred funds that I had invested in, venture funds, things like that, angel funds at roughly a 50% discount to their fair market value because... that's insane... because well they're private investments, right? And you know that selling an LP interest in a fund, there's no liquid market for that. So in order to even find a buyer, you have to make it super attractive for them. God. And then I sold, you know, xAI, I sold my interest in Grok and those were all at substantial discounts to the next round which has now taken place.

[39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2385s) So joining the government is not a money-making scheme. The simplest way for me to make more money would have just been to keep doing what I was doing. Yeah. Right. Just go back to the 449. So again, they're kind of pretending like they did this unbelievable investigation and they find the 449. Can you just put up this paragraph on the screen here? Because really every sentence in this paragraph kind of reveals the sham of this story. "Mr. Sacks has positioned himself to personally benefit." Not true. I mean, I was already an investor in all these companies and I positioned myself to divest.

[40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2420s) Then it says I had 449 stakes in companies with ties to artificial intelligence. By the way, that whole phrase "ties to" is total journalism weasel words because "ties to" can mean anything and every company in the economy is going to have ties to artificial intelligence. And then they said "could be aided directly or indirectly." That is not what a conflict of interest is. The standard is having a direct and predictable effect on an interest. Not indirect. And there's nothing in that story that shows that I had a direct benefit.

[40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2455s) This article has nothing to do with everything you guys just spent all this time talking about. Okay? There is nothing here. Okay? There was no crime here. There's no smoke here. There's no fire here. What you did get right though is the headline was the goal. And what is the goal of that headline? The goal of that headline is to insinuate and to pressure Sacks, but subtly it's to pressure everyone else that looks like Sacks.

[41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2485s) Now, what does it mean to look like Sacks? It's not just about Republican folks. This could be a Democratic person as well in the future. You're in industry. You know something very specific. You've done very well applying that knowledge. Now all of a sudden you're in a position where you could go and positively impact the trajectory of the United States. You're asked by the then sitting president of the United States to do something. What this article does is it tries to intimidate those kinds of people to say, "Wow, this is not worth it. This is just too much of a headache." The whole point was the headline and the whole point was to get enough chatter about the headline so that people like Sacks and then other people in the future just say, "You know what? I'm not going to try this."

[42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2530s) And what do they want instead? What they want instead are people that they can work with very closely and ultimately co-opt. If you look at people like Zoran Mumdani who's beloved by the New York Times or if you look at Lina Khan who's beloved by the New York Times as well, what's the through line? It's a total and complete lack of experience. And so what you're creating is essentially a very simple litmus test. If you have experience, we're going to paint you as conflicted. So stay away. But if you're completely inexperienced and have no experience whatsoever, have never done anything and you're probably going to screw it up. But at least you'll be in our pocket. We'll work with you and so we will leave you alone.

[42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2575s) That is the point of this article and that is what is on trial here. And I think what we all need to do is understand that simple thing and push back on it. Not just if you're a Republican, but also if you're a Democrat because there are tons of really smart people on both sides that will eventually be asked to do something for the United States and you need to ignore the idiots at the New York Times and do it.

[43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2605s) Yeah, this is well said and this literally was going to be the point I was going to make as well, which is we're setting up two worlds. Do you want... otherwise you will only... Exactly. You'll only have inexperienced morons in the government even help. It doesn't. And here's exactly such a good point that we have a choice right now. Do we want to have lawyers and academics with no experience in the real world setting policy in Washington DC or do you want to have experts? Do you want more Mike Bloombergs? Do you want more Jeff Bezos, more David Sacks, more Bessent, also a Democrat? Lutnick, also previously a Democrat. We want the smartest people in Washington DC. That's what the founders wanted.

[44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2645s) The founding fathers of this country wanted people to do short stints. We want short stints. We don't want career politicians like Nancy Pelosi or, you know, Mitch McConnell in there for 30, 40, 600 years. Like literally these people are like, look like zombies in Washington DC. They're glitching out. We want people in their prime of their careers to go in there Chamath like you're saying and kick ass for us for four or eight years and then come back.

[44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2675s) By the way, everybody benefits when you go to Washington DC and you make some connections. Of course, when the Clintons left office, what did they do? Clinton Foundation book deals, Obama's book deals, Netflix deals. Everybody gets a little shine when they come out. That's natural when you come out. But we want the best and brightest there. It's a gift that you went there, Sacks. It's a gift. I think... Yeah, we can debate all these issues. And yes, civil servants should be under scrutiny. Whether it's Lina Khan or USA, people should be held to account for anything they're doing. You did it right. You went above and beyond. And now they're trying to punish you and they're trying to dissuade the next group of great Americans from going there.

[45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2715s) Yeah. Well, thank you. Yeah. Go ahead. There are two quotes from Thomas Jefferson. I'll just read because I think it's actually very important. He said in a letter in 1788, "I apprehend that the total abandonment of the principle of rotation in the elected offices will end in abuse." And then he also later said in 1809, "Nature intended me for the tranquil pursuits of science, which is what he was into, by rendering them my supreme delight. But the enormities of the times in which I have lived have forced me to take a part in resisting them and to commit myself on the boisterous ocean of political passions."

[45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2755s) The founding fathers to your point Jason and Chamath were vehemently committed to the United States being a free market, being a place where people could pursue with absolute liberty their interests in business, in science, in life. And the action of political office of getting elected to a political office was out of a requirement to serve out of civil service to this country, service to the nation and service to the enablement of the freedoms that allow us to do the things that we choose and want to do.

[46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2790s) And if you look at the wealth that's been accumulated by these career politicians, it is no surprise that they are attacking Sacks and Bessent and Lutnick and Kelly Loeffler and all of these other elected or appointed officials in this government who have had success in private life and who have chosen out of a commitment to patriotism to spend their time rather than making money in private life. They have enough money but to try and get the government and the country on the track that they hope it will go on.

[47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2825s) And I think that that is the key difference between those who see this article for what it is and those who read it to reaffirm their I would say violent opposition to what is this current administration and the challenge that's ahead. So, I think it's a real Rorschach test when you read these articles and you look at Sacks and others in this administration and the choices that they've made to say, are they doing it to grift or are they doing it because they don't need to grift?

[47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2860s) Let me just also say this, proof is in the pudding. If we send experts to Washington DC, if you look at Sacks's early track record, you got the stablecoin stuff done. We just talked about how competitive the AI market is. We talked about building more energy. This, you know, and again, I disagree with a lot of the things in the Trump administration. The thing I don't disagree with and I fully endorse is the experts and the great job they're doing. Howard Lutnick's crushing it. You're crushing it. All these regulations that you've gotten done early and often are making crypto legal, a legal framework for crypto, which by the way, the last two administrations, the 45th and the 46th didn't get done. You got it done in six months, right? There's already a track record here. If you send experts, they'll get expert stuff done on time on startup speed. So like what? Let's talk about the results as well.

[48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2910s) Yeah. I mean, look, they don't want the results. I mean, they consider the results to be a negative. And what they're trying to do is criminalize policy disagreements. That's really what's going on. Now, at one point, my comms person who was dealing with the New York Times asked them, you know, what friends are you talking about? Like what friends did he benefit? And they couldn't name a specific one. I think this is why you guys, why they mentioned AllIn Tequila and the AllIn Summit, is I think maybe they're trying to portray you guys as the friends who benefited, somehow we sold more... say I... summit.

[49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2945s) Let me just say one thing on AllIn. We can't get speakers to come on the show because of the association with the Trump administration. We lost money on that event in June that I spent 12 days of my life working on. It was a pain in my ass. There was no personal benefit to us for any of this. There's no grifting going on. It's honestly a pain in the ass. We do it for Sacks because he wanted us to help him out with putting that event on. Sacks, now you're part time on the show. We have... You're here.

[49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=2980s) From the get-go, it was a nonprofit event. We did not sell tickets. We gave them all away for free. If we wanted to make money, you sell tickets. We didn't do that. Two sponsors that put money in to help defray the cost because we spent like a million plus dollars on this thing. They got their logo on the video. Not even in the live event. It was just on the video when we put it on YouTube, which was our... Disc. Let's move on. Disgust to the New York Times. But there's no benefit to AllIn. There's no benefit to AllIn. And the fact that they had to throw that in kind of shows if you ask me, but yeah, I concur. It's because they kitchen sink this thing to try and create the illusion that there was something there.

[50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3020s) All right. So, we knew this would take over the show because we're all hot under the collar and we all know you're doing a great job there. We want more experts. The job description is to have us win AI. Yes, that's what they're accusing me of is basically doing my job. Congratulations. You did a great job and now we're going to lie about you in the New York Times. But you're friends with Jensen Huang and now Jensen can sell chips. Oh my god. Do you want to show the fact check? It's so crazy. The fact check. This guy is the CEO of the largest company in the world for years. He's been meticulously designing these chips for 30 years. Before Sacks could even spell H100, he had made them for gamers. He was making video game cards years ago.

[51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3065s) Okay, wait. We got, I got to show this, an example of how dishonest they are. So, they would send us these fact checks every couple weeks. Okay. So, here's the real email, Sacks. They were sending you bullet point after bullet points. This section starts at bullet point number 33. It's obviously one of many emails you got. What they do in these fact checks is they basically take the story that they're planning to write and just break it up into chunks and then they give you like 24 hours to respond to each sentence or paragraph and say whether you know you agree or disagree with it and give you the chance to make a statement. That's what a fact check is.

[51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3105s) So this is the story they were planning on writing which is "In the spring, Sacks had dinner with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in Washington. They discussed several foreign export issues. During the dinner, Sacks heard a convincing counterargument that selling American chips to rivals including China will get those nations hooked on US tech. Sacks then took that argument to the White House and pushed officials to eliminate binary restrictions," etc., etc. There's just one problem with this narrative. There was no such dinner. We checked my schedule. They made up the dinner. No, we checked everyone's schedules. There is no dinner. So, they've got a source who's just making this up.

[52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3150s) And how does the New York Times respond? They just delete the dinner, but they don't delete any other part of this. But if your source has already been caught fabricating a dinner at which this conversation supposedly took place, it's totally discredited. They're trying to intimidate you. They kind of create this insinuation that somehow I'm being influenced through friendships. But then it turns out that those friendships don't even exist. I mean, they're just people I met after I joined the administration in a lot of cases.

[53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3180s) So, in any event, look, I think the audience of the show knows my views on AI because I've been publicly advocating for them for a past year. And you've had scrutiny. We ask you hard questions every week here. We bust your chops and force you to explain these positions and we stress test them with you and the audience stress tests them. That's like a gift to the American people. And I think it's very hard for people to contemplate the idea that folks who are significantly wealthy don't actually need to self-deal. Like they just don't need it. And the truth is the folks who are trying to build a career in politics are the ones who are necessarily going to self-deal because that's the path to wealth for them. And if you've already found your path to wealth, you don't need to self-deal. And I think it's just so hard for people to grasp that.

[53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3230s) Yeah. It's hard to understand that somebody is losing a massive amount of money serving their country. I for one thank you for losing all of his money and going and serving the country. I'm very proud. Even if people don't agree with your politics, even if I don't agree with everything you say or do, Sacks, again, I never doubt your integrity and your intentions. And I'll say that just personally having known you for a very long time. Great. I appreciate that. Thank you.

[54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3260s) I'm mad at you because you didn't sell me everything at 50% discount. Yeah. Where's... the first time I heard it? I was... I've been so angry this whole clip thinking what... where was my call? Oh my god. I would have given you 55%. Give it to me. Hey, I would have bought it. Another story that's been trending is the new poverty line and some of these incoming tax laws.

[54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3290s) Mike Green, an investor and fund manager, went viral last week for claiming the US poverty line math is very wrong. Historically, the poverty line has been measured as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 adjusted for inflation. Based on that measures, the poverty line for a family is set at $31,000 in 2025. Green says the real number is over 4x higher at $140,000. He gets that number by factoring the cost of childcare which has surpassed housing as the largest average expense. He says measuring this number for decades has quietly broken America and it could explain why America's middle class feels poorer despite healthy GDP and historically low unemployment 4.x which we've talked about here.

[55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3335s) Chamath, your thoughts. I read this, I found his claim to be pretty shocking. So, I just wanted to dig into it. That's why I asked that we talked about it. Nick, you can probably link to it, but yeah, this thing went viral. And basically, it's exactly what you said, Jason. Food costs used to be a third of living costs. And so, food used to cost 10,000. You would multiply it by three and say, well, the total cost of living is 33,000. That's the poverty line.

[56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3365s) And then what the government did was they created a whole bunch of staircase incentives to get people from about 33,000 to about 2x that number to about 65,000. And then after that you were mostly on your own where there were no real benefits like SNAP or other things. But what this person was saying is like hey hold on a second, food costs are now five or 6%. And so if you gross it up for the other components, shouldn't the poverty line be something closer to 140k? And that's a shocking claim. And so I just spent a little bit of time looking into it.

[56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3400s) Now he has subsequently come back and refined some of the things he said. I think he may have written it in a heated moment. So for example, when he looked at that number, he wasn't looking at national averages. He was looking at a bunch of data from a high-cost suburb of New York City. I think it was like Essex County. And so if you look at the food costs plus transportation plus energy plus housing plus child care in other places that are more a median American city. The example that I think other people were using was Lynchburg, Virginia, just as an example. It does change pretty drastically.

[57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3435s) You can use this thing called the MIT living wage calculator which we did. And if you are in Lynchburg, Virginia, the income required for a family of four to meet all expenses there is not 140k, but it's about 93k. That's still quite a big difference. And when you double click into where these variances come, a lot of it looks like it's around housing and childcare. And I didn't appreciate how much and how expensive child care has actually become from anywhere between $1,000 to $3,000 per month, which is obviously a lot of money.

[57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3470s) The other thing is that his original article was claiming that if you're above 33K but under 65K, you're actually better off staying at 33 because every time you go up, you actually lose a benefit. So the net effect is that you are becoming poorer. And it turns out that that math was actually false. When you calculate the net resources, meaning income plus benefits minus taxes and expenses, a family actually as they step up the staircase does earn more in disposable resources than a family that's earning less.

[58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3505s) There is a very specific part of though what he said which I think we should focus on which is there is an area between $45,000 a year and $63,000 a year which actually looks like a bit of a stagnation zone. So to the extent that one is to read this article, take away the kind of the buzzy title and whatnot, the thing that is important is to narrowly focus on this one issue, which is that we do have some policy failures in this zone where earning an extra dollar often results in losing a dollar of benefits like SNAP and other things.

[59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3540s) But that's a good thing to know because now we can narrowly say okay what are states and what can the federal government do for people in just this part of the valley, this sort of like death valley. The last thing is the article was saying look there is no real middle class. There are the people that are above 140k and then there's everybody else in poverty. And if you look at the census data and you look at the percentage of Americans that are struggling, those that earn between 100 and 200% of poverty, that percentage has actually fallen.

[59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3575s) So the good news is the American economy seems to be doing a good job of not just getting people out of poverty, but getting people out of that struggling bracket, out of that death valley, and into a place where they're making 200% of that poverty line. So they're moving up. So the article was important because I do think it starts to say, look, this affordability thing has become a buzzword. A lot of people on the left and the right are using it to try to implement and affect policy. It's really important for us to be grounded in the facts of it.

[60:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3610s) And the facts are that child care costs have become an overwhelming burden for many families. We probably need to figure out a way to deal with that. Housing costs are out of control. For younger people, student debt is problematic. But on the other side, the American economy still does an incredible job of getting people from those lower rungs to multiple hundred percentages of that poverty line to get them on the way. And we just need to figure out how to push people up that staircase faster.

[60:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3645s) So, and it feels like this dovetails Chamath with a discussion we had a couple of weeks ago when a viral clip of Ben Shapiro talking about, hey, just opt out of New York City, opt out of San Francisco, and this whole thing looks completely different. You know, the idea of somebody who is up and coming living in Manhattan or San Francisco is a bit crazy. And in other countries, we don't look at living in Paris or Hong Kong, you know, or Dubai as like that's where you start your career and you live in the city center.

[61:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3675s) Yeah. Friedberg, you're saying people like would move. I'm not sure. The point I'm making is to define a poverty line for San Francisco versus Austin or Houston is incredibly different because the cost of living is dramatically different, two, three, 4x. You know, the cost of a nanny in San Francisco or New York is dramatically different than if you live 30 minutes outside of a city center.

[61:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3705s) One of the challenges America faces is government programs create an anchor. They are a shackle. They hold people back when they were supposed to be support payments. And the problem with this that this article highlights is that the supposed support payments actually create an incentive or a challenge in moving up the rung or up the ladder. It's probably the case that it is a lot easier to move up the income ladder if you're in certain parts of the country than if you're in most of the country. And so most of the country is stagnating wages, but they still feel the effects of inflation. And these government programs keep them stuck in the position that they're in.

[62:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3745s) This is the spiral of socialism. The government programs that are meant to provide support to people require an increase in taxation. That revenue has to come from somewhere. That taxation ultimately leads to an attrition of economic value in that region and then you have to increase taxation more and then you end up in this spiral. And we're seeing this now not just in New York where Mumdani is proposing to increase taxes but across the entire West Coast.

[63:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3780s) We talked about the 5% billionaire tax that's being proposed as a constitutional amendment to go on the ballot in November. There's also a major challenge underway in Oregon where the governor is now trying to figure out how to keep businesses in the state. The CEO of Columbia Sportswear, one of the biggest employers in the state, came out this week saying that his advisers have recommended that he leave the state. And in Washington, there is a proposed bill right now to implement a 5% tax on the payroll of employees making over $125,000 per year. And Microsoft, Amazon, Costco, and some of the other big employers in that state are now trying to figure out what they should do.

[63:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3820s) And in California, as you guys know, in the last couple of quarters, Tesla, Chevron, McKesson, Oracle, Charles Schwab, CB Richard Ellis, Hewlett Packard have all left the state. Palantir, SpaceX, I could go down this list because as the tax burden becomes too high on those companies and there's an alternative to them in the country, they'll leave. And then you have this spiral that happens where the people that are in that state say, "Wait a second. There's no jobs. There's no income gain. We need to increase taxation." And the tax bills get passed.

[64:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3855s) Norway 2022 passed a wealth tax. The wealth tax was supposed to raise $146 million of incremental revenue per year. Instead, what happened? $54 billion of net worth left the country. And they actually had a $448 million tax loss. The taxes declined rather than... Did they reverse it afterwards or? No, I'm actually not sure the state of Norway.

[64:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3890s) Microsoft's president Brad Smith has said that tech jobs are going to leave Washington state if this payroll tax gets passed. And this is the cycle that's underway. And it starts with the government spending. If we didn't have the government spending the way it does, where the government's running a deficit, California is now expected to have a $50 billion plus dollar deficit, then they don't need to increase taxes. And this is the core motivation.

[65:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3925s) Once you're hooked on the government for some sort of benefit, it's very hard to unhook yourself. It's very hard for a company or a union or an organization to unhook themselves and it definitionally becomes a spiral. You will not give up that benefit. And so you have to spend incrementally more and more and more and more and as you raise taxes, you end up losing the tax base and it becomes a deficit spiral. That's what leads to socialism. And we have seen it time and again.

[66:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3960s) It's not a big revolution. It's not like we see where you go from socialism to democratic capitalism where you have a revolution in the streets. Socialism emerges slowly. It's like a quiet sort of hum and then it becomes a roar and all of a sudden you're a frog in a pot and you don't realize you're being boiled.

[66:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=3990s) Pull this up, this clip from... this is episode 7 of AllIn. I don't think democracies end with a bang. I think they end with a whimper. And I think that's been the case historically. And you know, no democracy has lasted... our democracy in the US has lasted longer than many. Democracies ultimately enable freedom of operation and free markets that result in greater progress than any other governing system.

[67:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4020s) The problem with progress is that progress is asymmetric. You have some people who progress at a much greater rate than most. And it is that delta that motivates the end of that system ultimately. While everyone in the United States or the average and even the bottom quartile of the population in the US is better off than they were 50 years ago in terms of income and healthcare and shelter and access to food and access to all these things. The top 1% of the US is further ahead than the median. And it is that delta that motivates the end of democracy.

[67:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4060s) And it is that which is then perceived to be unfair about this governing system. And that ultimately results in fascism or socialism. And then fascism... socialism ultimately restricts anyone from progression. And that's why fascism and socialism ultimately end up in some sort of, you know, democratic outcome. And it is a cycle. And, you know, we're kind of in this, you know, awkward phase of trying to figure out what the hell we're going to be next. And I don't think that awkward phase is realized in the next presidential term, but it is going to be realized in our lifetime.

[68:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4095s) And I think that's where we're headed. Midterms probably going to go to the Democrats in the House. And I think you're seeing Ro Khanna, Gavin Newsom yesterday on stage at Dealbook talked about redistributing wealth. Ro Khanna is talking about redistributing wealth. This is becoming the Democrat party line and they're going to end up trying to seize this moment to take these socialist principles because everyone is feeling the burn. They're feeling the loss of benefits. They're feeling the lack of progress. They're having a tough time moving up the income ladder and they're having a tough time paying their bills.

[68:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4135s) And so this is the moment where this democratic socialist movement takes foot. And probably by 2028, the presidential nominee is going to be not necessarily a self-declared, but probably a referenceable, you know, socialist. Democrat socialist. Yeah, democrat socialist. I mean, best advice, have two plans. One, a state that is committed to capitalism. Texas comes to mind. And number two, you kind of have to have a country as a backup plan in case this goes across the whole country.

[69:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4170s) Have you guys been tracking the California wealth tax? As a former California resident, I'm curious how you're interpreting these recent moves. I think we're all seriously thinking about moving out. I mean, it's kind of crazy. But did you see, I think Newsom came out and said that he was going to oppose it. Is that right? But it doesn't matter because if the California voters voted in, it goes immediately into a... Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth here. I think this is a moment to thank Governor Newsom for representing the interests of tech oligarchs like us. We really appreciate you coming out against this wealth tax.

[70:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4210s) Thank you. So thank you. We really appreciate it on behalf of all the tech oligarchs. Thank you for opposing this wealth tax. In fact, the All-In podcast endorses Gavin Newsom's support of billionaires and centi-millionaires everywhere. He supports all of us equally, even the poor centi-millionaires and as high as the billionaires and even the deca-billionaires. We have some... Thank you for standing up against the Bernie Sanders AOC wing of the party. Yes. If... somebody has to stand up against this democratic socialism and Gavin Newsom is the guy.

[70:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4250s) What do you think happens if there's just a tax 5% of all net worth and you have a bunch of illiquid private assets? What are you supposed to do? Chaos. Yeah. It's going to be a mess. By the way, what that bill Chamath says is you can have a deferral. So, you can actually defer the tax payment, but you have to have it booked that year. So, well, you can defer it, but you can defer it into 1/5th payable for a year for 5 years. So, that's not really a deferral. That's just installments that I think they said to 5 to 7% interest.

[71:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4285s) Let's just say that we could do a financing for something that we've started, but it just all of a sudden what is a financing? It's nothing. It's somebody's guess about future value. It has nothing to do with today's value. Right. But if a financing for a company all of a sudden would trigger a bunch of phantom tax that's due... right... that I, I mean I'll be honest, I don't have money sitting around to pay 5% of an imputed valuation of a company that I'm in the midst of building.

[72:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4320s) Look at what Sacks just talked about. He had to sell his private assets at a 50% discount. Oh, I would have to... I would have to exact. So, you create this like negative reflexive downward spiral. And it doesn't stop there. So, think about where this goes. So, yes, that's a problem for rich people. Great. No one gives a shit about us. No one gives a shit about people that have to sell highly valued private stock.

[72:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4350s) But where does this go? In the proposed billionaire tax, it actually gives power and authority to the California state legislature that they can actually redo this wealth tax at a different level and a different rate in the future. Think about what that does. It now gives property seizure rights to the California state legislature to set a value level. So anyone now that's got over a hundred million net worth and then it becomes over 10 million and then anyone with a million dollar net worth and the state can take 5% of your assets every year. Very quickly it becomes the process by which socialism and the socialization of assets that gets seized by the government is realized.

[73:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4390s) So what's the bulwark on this? What how... This is why I've been saying for years this is the direction we're headed because the... I give you the victory. Congrats. But the root cause of it is government spending. I think it's pretty straightforward. You just move to a state that is committed to capitalism and... But then it becomes a federal decision... and then if that doesn't work you're going to need to have an escape hatch to Dubai.

[73:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4420s) We have a problem in this country and the problem is too much progress. Too much progress too fast has led to a distribution of capital that is so asymmetric that Gavin Newsom said on stage yesterday 10% of the population own 2/3 of the assets. That may or may not seem right to you but that is the reality of what happens when you have progress, when you build technology companies, when you build car companies, when you build... when America wins globally. You say America, but it's not all Americans. And this is the point. This is what's going on.

[74:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxi6LVKanuY&t=4455s) Those of us who are on this Zoom and our cohort of friends are the ones who have mostly benefited from America quote winning. The rest of America has been left behind. True. And the mechanism for recapture, the mechanism for restoration of equality as everyone views it is these measures, these voting measures, these elected officials.
