# Europe's Free Speech Failure and the "Censorship Industrial Complex" with Sarah B. Rogers

## Summary

Jason and Sacks sit down with Sarah B. Rogers, Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy at the State Department, to discuss the growing divide between American and European approaches to free speech. Rogers explains her role in public diplomacy - building relationships not just between governments but between the U.S. government and foreign publics - and why this is newly critical in an era of declining trust in institutions.

The conversation focuses heavily on Europe's Digital Services Act (DSA) and Online Safety Act (OSA), which Rogers characterizes as a form of "censorship tariff" on American tech companies. She argues these regulations, ostensibly about protecting users from "harmful content," have become tools for suppressing legitimate political speech, particularly around sensitive topics like mass migration. Examples include German authorities pressuring platforms to remove criticism of migration policies and UK citizens being arrested for social media posts.

Rogers draws connections between European censorship efforts and the "Censorship Industrial Complex" that emerged in the United States during the Biden administration - NGOs, academic centers, and government agencies coordinating to pressure platforms to suppress speech. She emphasizes that the Trump administration is committed to free speech both domestically and in pushing back against European overreach. The discussion concludes with optimism that giving freedom the benefit of the doubt, even with risks like AI deepfakes, is preferable to a censorship regime.

## Highlights

### "Public Diplomacy: Government to People, Not Government to Government"

> "Diplomacy traditionally concerns the relationship between the American government and foreign governments. But public diplomacy is different - it addresses the relationship between the American government and foreign publics. That's become very important as trust in institutions has declined."
> — Sarah B. Rogers, [2:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e59hzyoKQCs&t=142s)

### "The DSA is a Censorship Tariff on American Companies"

> "The Digital Services Act is essentially a censorship tariff. Europe is forcing American tech companies to censor speech that would be protected under the First Amendment or face massive fines. It's protectionism disguised as user safety."
> — Sarah B. Rogers, [13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e59hzyoKQCs&t=824s)

### "Mass Migration Criticism Being Censored in Germany"

> "In Germany, if you criticize mass migration policies on social media, the government can pressure platforms to remove your posts or even have you arrested. This is legitimate political speech being criminalized. It's deeply troubling for those of us who value free expression."
> — Sarah B. Rogers, [16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e59hzyoKQCs&t=1015s)

> "The Censorship Industrial Complex is this network of NGOs, academic centers, government agencies, all coordinating to identify 'misinformation' and pressure platforms to remove it. But who decides what's misinformation? Usually it's just speech they disagree with politically."
