# Inside America's AI Strategy: Infrastructure, Regulation, and Global Competition

## Summary

David Sacks joins Michael Kratsios (former US CTO, now leading Scale AI's government initiatives) for a panel moderated by Maria Bartiromo at Davos, diving deep into America's strategy to maintain AI leadership. The discussion centers on whether the massive AI infrastructure buildout is sustainable or a repeat of the dot-com fiber bubble. Kratsios and Sacks argue the difference is real demand - companies are actually using AI and generating revenue, unlike the '90s speculative fiber buildout.

The panel explores where AI will have the most transformative impact, with healthcare, education, and government services highlighted as areas ripe for productivity gains. They address the China threat, debating whether decoupling or selective engagement is the right strategy. Both Kratsios and Sacks emphasize that while China has capabilities, America's entrepreneurial culture and open ecosystem give it a structural advantage.

The conversation concludes with discussion of how America can maintain its lead through diffusion - getting AI tools broadly deployed across all sectors of the economy, not just keeping them in research labs. They argue that regulatory restraint, capital availability, and platform effects will determine whether American AI companies achieve the same global dominance as American internet companies did in the previous era.

## Highlights

### "The Difference From Dot-Com: Real Demand Exists"

> "In the late '90s, we built all this fiber infrastructure speculatively with no real demand. Today's AI buildout is different - the demand is there. Companies are using these models, generating revenue, solving real problems. That's why this isn't a bubble."
> — Michael Kratsios, [1:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyP-euljCHM&t=95s)

### "AI Will Transform Government Services"

```
</details>

> "In the Global South, 40-50% of GDP is public sector. If AI makes governments 10-20% more efficient at delivering services, that's multiple points of GDP growth right there. This is transformative for developing nations."
> — David Sacks, [12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyP-euljCHM&t=762s)

### "China Has Capabilities, But America Has Culture"

```

> "China has smart people, capital, and ambition. But what they don't have is the entrepreneurial culture, the willingness to fail fast, the open ecosystem that produces breakthrough innovation. That's America's structural advantage."
> — Michael Kratsios, [22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyP-euljCHM&t=1359s)

### "Tech Will Be Higher Percentage of GDP in 5 Years"

> "This isn't zero-sum. The TAM is expanding. Five years from now, technology will be a higher percentage of global GDP. The question is whether American companies will capture the majority of that value or whether we'll cede ground to China."
