# Cathie Wood on How AI Can Double GDP, Bull Case for Bitcoin $1M, Elon's Trillion-Dollar Pay Package

## Summary

Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, delivers a presentation at the All-In Summit making the case that five converging innovation platforms -- robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and multiomic sequencing -- will drive real GDP growth from the historical 3% toward 7%+ over the next 5-10 years while pushing inflation toward 0% or lower. She explains that for the first time in 125 years, multiple major technology platforms are converging simultaneously, citing autonomous mobility (robotics + energy storage + AI) and healthcare (genomics + AI + CRISPR) as key examples.

In the Q&A portion, Wood discusses ARK's official bull case of $1.5 million per Bitcoin (with portfolio optimization models suggesting $3.8 million), her $2,600 price target for Tesla based on robotaxi and humanoid robot convergence, and her support for Elon Musk's milestone-based compensation package. She advocates strongly for opening private market access to retail investors, arguing that the current accredited investor system is "un-American" and suggesting a simple competency test instead.

Wood also reveals that ARK is moving its own incorporation out of Delaware, calling the state's judiciary "activist" for overriding Tesla shareholders on Musk's pay package, and shares her strategy of concentrating positions during bear markets and diversifying during bull markets.

## Transcript

[0:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=2s) One of the most disruptive and innovative forces in the ETF world today, the investor queen Cathie Wood. The ARK Innovation ETF trading now near a 52-week high returned an astounding 148%, returning more than 170% last year, now has $17 billion under management. My conviction is so high because of what I do on a day-to-day basis. We are doing original research trying to figure out these companies that are going to transform the world.

[0:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=49s) Well, greetings. I'm so delighted to be here. My maiden voyage. And I am here to talk about how the world's going to transform during the next 5 to 10 years and how much more rapidly we will see real GDP grow and how low inflation is going to be and why. Here is a timeline of innovation. Our chief futurist Brett Winton in conjunction with academics pulled this together and what you're seeing here is the impact of innovation on productivity. We've had two great eras. The first one was in the late 1800s, early 1900s: telephone, electricity, internal combustion engine, huge boost in GDP growth.

[2:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=131s) Prior to that, for the 400 years prior, real GDP growth had been averaging about 0.6% per year. After that, we went into a 125-year period of 3% real GDP growth. A five-fold increase from 0.6 to 3%. You have to move forward to today to see multiple innovation platforms evolving at the same time. For the first time in 125 years, there are five platforms, not three, and they involve 15 different technologies. This is very important in terms of how to research and analyze the world. It's not going to be by sector or industry anymore. It is going to be by technology.

[3:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=188s) We believe that the productivity uplift is going to be so strong during the next 5 to 10 years. And I think President Trump's tax package is going to turbocharge this, that real GDP growth will accelerate from that 3% towards 7% plus. And we think that could be conservative. But the other thing that we think is going to happen is that inflation is going to surprise significantly on the low side of expectations. We would not be surprised to see 0% inflation or less.

[4:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=255s) One of the reasons for this explosion is not just the five platforms: robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and multiomic sequencing. Five major platforms involving 15 different technologies. And here you can see why we think we're going to see explosive growth. It is the convergence between and among these technologies. In the autonomous mobility space, that is the convergence of robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. One S-curve feeding another S-curve feeding another S-curve.

[5:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=332s) Another example is in the healthcare space. While the autonomous mobility space might be the biggest revenue generator in the short term, we believe that the most profound application of AI is in healthcare and that's the convergence of sequencing technologies and artificial intelligence and technologies like CRISPR gene editing. And I think this is the sleeper. It's the most inefficiently priced part of the market.

[6:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=384s) Here is what we think is going to happen to the equity market. The Mag 6 tripled from 2019 to 2024. Whereas truly disruptive innovation went up only 30%. That's because investors were playing it safe. And now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine. I feel as though a rubber band has been stretching for the last four years and it let go with the election of Donald Trump. That's when truly disruptive innovation started to shine and the stock market started to broaden out.

[8:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=496s) The tax package, especially the corporate tax cuts, which most people haven't focused on: full depreciation of structures first year they're put in service, full expensing of equipment, R&D domestic and software in year 1. These are huge incentives to invest now. The truly disruptive innovation we would expect to deliver a compound annual rate of return of roughly 50%.

[9:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=563s) You're projecting in 5 years, Bitcoin hits 3.8 million per coin. Let me correct that a bit. Our official bull case is $1.5 million. What got us to that $3.8 million is using modern portfolio theory. If we were to include Bitcoin in portfolios at its optimal weight, maximizing the Sharpe ratio, that position size was 19% of a diversified portfolio. What I've told my children for a long time is average in. Every month, just average in.

[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=673s) ARK has this ability to be a vehicle for folks who want to participate in the future. There's a lot of people that are frustrated with an inability to build wealth. What is economically happening in America that prevents so many people? One of the questions I get regularly from retail investors used to be, why can't we access the private markets? We know more about those technologies than most of the institutions who are buying them. This administration is becoming more focused on this because it is un-American.

[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=782s) You use ChatGPT every day, but you can't buy OpenAI. But you can buy a lottery ticket or you can bet on sports, and it makes no sense. Should we just have a simple accreditation test? You understand diversification, you understand private versus public assets, how to read a balance sheet -- wouldn't that just solve the problem? What we're doing in the investment world right now would be the equivalent of saying you can't drive because you don't make enough money. Take a test.

[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=872s) There's a lot of market signals right now that are flashing green and red. In terms of what we do to control risk during bear markets, we will concentrate towards our highest conviction names. We have a scoring system based on management, execution, moat, product, leadership, valuation, and thesis risk. During bull markets, we tend to diversify because the IPOs start appearing again.

[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=961s) Give us the read on Elon's trillion-dollar pay package. We put out a model once a year of Tesla with our price target five years out. We looked at his package and said that looks like our model. Our price target is $2,600. I think it's at $330 today. And we have very little for humanoid robots in there. But what Elon is capitalizing on is this convergence: robotics, energy storage, and AI.

[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=1057s) I think it's huge. I wish more CEOs would do this. Elon's not going to be paid unless he reaches these milestones either. Everything's physics-based and milestone based. He's very disciplined. If people do not know that about Elon, they should.

[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJ_ouDNNT0&t=1092s) As a stock picker, do you care where the companies are incorporated? We're not an activist investor, but we are moving out of Delaware. They're not predictable now and they're activist. What business do they have overriding the shareholders of Tesla when it comes to a pay package? That guy owned 10 shares. He did a 20-bagger and then he's got the right to take away Elon's pay. Cathie Wood, thank you so much for sharing so much knowledge.
