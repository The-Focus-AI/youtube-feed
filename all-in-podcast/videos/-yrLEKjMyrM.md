# Coinbase CEO's Top 3 Crypto Trends for 2026 + More from Davos!

## Summary

Jason Calacanis hosts three CEO interviews from Davos, starting with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong discussing the three major crypto trends he sees accelerating in 2026: institutional adoption of stablecoins, Layer 2 scaling solutions reaching mainstream usability, and on-chain identity/verification enabling new financial services. Armstrong reveals that five of the top 20 global banks are now using Coinbase to build crypto infrastructure, and predicts that stablecoins will handle trillions in annual transaction volume as they become the default payment rails for internet commerce.

Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman explains how his company's wafer-scale processors are revolutionizing AI training by offering 100x faster training times than traditional GPU clusters. He argues that time-to-insight is more valuable than cost-per-FLOP, and that being able to train a model in days rather than months creates massive strategic advantage. The discussion covers the physics limits of Moore's Law and why specialized AI chips are the future.

Gecko Robotics CEO Jake Loosararian demonstrates how AI-powered robots are transforming industrial infrastructure inspection, finding critical failures in power plants, ships, and pipelines that human inspectors miss. He shares stories of preventing catastrophic failures that could have killed workers or caused environmental disasters, making the case that AI + physical robots represent the next frontier after digital AI agents.

## Highlights

### "Five of Top 20 Global Banks Now Using Coinbase"

> "Five of the top 20 global banks in the world are now using Coinbase to build their crypto infrastructure. A couple are public - JP Morgan, PNC Bank. This is the institutional adoption wave. Banks are realizing crypto is infrastructure for the internet economy."
> — Brian Armstrong, [7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrLEKjMyrM&t=420s)

### "Stablecoins Will Be the Payment Rails of Internet Commerce"

> "Stablecoins are going to be how money moves on the internet. Not Bitcoin, not Ethereum - stablecoins backed by dollars. Instant settlement, programmable, low cost. Every internet company will build on this infrastructure. We're talking trillions in annual volume."
> — Brian Armstrong, [18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrLEKjMyrM&t=1080s)

### "Cerebras Trains Models 100x Faster Than GPU Clusters"

> "Time is the scarce resource in AI, not compute. If I can train your model in 3 days instead of 3 months, that's transformative. You can iterate faster, respond to competitors faster, deploy features faster. We're 100x faster than traditional GPU clusters for training."
> — Andrew Feldman, [45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrLEKjMyrM&t=2731s)

### "Our Robots Found Cracks That Would Have Killed Workers"

> "We deployed our robots at a power plant and found stress cracks in a boiler that human inspectors had missed for years. If that boiler had failed during operation, it would have killed workers and potentially caused a catastrophic explosion. AI + robotics saves lives."
