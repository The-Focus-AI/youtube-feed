# Live Poker Match!: The Besties Vs. Phil Hellmuth, Alan Keating, and Jason Koon

## Summary

The All-In Podcast hosts a live poker tournament at the Venetian Las Vegas, pitting the "besties" (Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sacks, David Friedberg, and Jason Calacanis) against poker legends Phil Hellmuth (16-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner), Alan Keating (high-stakes cash game specialist), and Jason Koon (one of the greatest cash game players with over $70 million in winnings). The tournament features a rapid blind structure with entertaining table talk and several dramatic hands.

The highlight of the tournament comes early when Phil Hellmuth, widely considered one of the greatest tournament players of all time, becomes the first player eliminated after losing to Alan Keating. This sends the table into celebration, with Chamath exclaiming "Nothing better than Hellmuth not winning!" The besties take great pleasure in ribbing Hellmuth about his early exit. Molly Bloom, the famous poker hostess whose story was depicted in the film "Molly's Game," makes a guest appearance mid-tournament.

The tournament concludes with Chamath Palihapitiya winning the "First Annual All-In Venetian 5-Minute Turbo Bounty" after heads-up play against Jason Calacanis, holding pocket kings against ace-seven. Throughout the game, the players share poker stories, discuss legendary player Stu Ungar, debate whether to attend the Bahamas poker tournament, plan skiing trips to Tahoe, and discuss Formula One racing. Alan Keating shares an entertaining story about getting into a near-fistfight at Carbone restaurant the night before.

It's probably rude for me to even ask, but I would. I won't explain my reads on you. I will never reveal. Yes, please. Yeah, just take them to the grave, man. Just keep printing checks off me year after year. Since you asked, I will take a cappuccino.

[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1576s) All I want is full Tahoe, four sugars. I don't want to lose that. I'm always there. A little bit of lard in it.

We'll all be up there. We can make it a business. Christmas. You have to be there. Yeah, I will.

Are you going to be solo, buddy? You stay right. I might have an extra room. I have no rooms for you. There's rooms for you. I have 8,000 children. Yeah. Actually, I mean, 50/50. I have a room. I have to see if I'll have to figure that out. His house is sick. He's got a movie theater. Yeah.

[27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1622s) Do you ski? I have a ski in ski out house. It's a little smaller than his house probably. But you're on the location where you killer in. He's like walking distance. Like but in the next door property, you basically walk. You think I'm like too old to start skiing? No. Just easy peasy. And then I'll take you out for a day. Pizza's up there. And up there, Phil's up there.

[27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1658s) Girly. Where are you guys going? I'm going New Year's. Yeah. I'm going to be there December. We got to play some poker. I may pop up for New Year's. I would like to play some kind of like a new game like learn a new game like Razz or Stud. We could do like some random games that none of us have ever played before.

[27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1675s) I just yeah. I would like to play low stakes like some Chinese half deck. No, no. Like what do you want? You don't want the short deck. No, no. I would love short deck with an ante. Yeah. No, no. Let's play short deck. If we play short deck slow, don't worry guys, we'll learn this all together. I don't know how to play any of the like stud games.

[28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1697s) Oh my god. Please hold up. I got the six of the ace of the choppy. WOW. YES, YES, YES. OH MY GOD. So great. What a call by me. Choppy. Choppy. Wow. Why do I not get rewarded for such stellar play? Unbelievable. It was a really good call.

[28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1725s) Nothing better than Hellmuth not winning. There is nothing better than that. Not I do feel that way. Yeah. It's so great when he doesn't win. Yeah. When he had when he what is it? 15. He turns the 153. Okay. Oh, you don't like it when I do that, do you?

[29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1740s) For the viewers, one thing that they I thought if you had a pair, you would call. I have to move in with ace high there. I think one thing the viewers should know about poker is all the money in the middle makes it so that you don't have to get your money in in front for it to be profitable. That's like an important thing for people to understand.

[29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1763s) Sometimes even if you know you're beat, if you're being laid a price to gamble, sometimes you have to gamble and it's better than folding. That's something and I think there's a lot of analogies to that in business. Yep. Life decision making. Yeah. Like sometimes you know you have Having the best hand is kind of lame to be honest. It's rare. It doesn't happen often some nights happens a lot, but you hold them. It's hard to make a good hand. That's why it's the best game.

[29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1794s) PLO, I feel like it's been sold as if it's an action game. But you come into the hand with king 10, 74. You're facing king, queen, jack, 10, and pocket kings and aces. So many hands. There's no board where you're dominate. Yeah. Or your advantage. You can't catch. Short-handed. It's true. Short-handed.

[30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1825s) I'm going to need a little advice. I said all in. No, I He went all in. But I think it's been sold as a gambler's game when this is going to be a big decision for me. How much chips did he have left? All in. He could have ace king here. He could have king queen here. He's got like 193 or something. I think this would be a very tough decision for me.

[30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1840s) He doesn't have aces, but he could have ace king. He could have king queen. Could he do that with queens or tens? He knows I could have a king. Really difficult decision. Could have. Could he have any of those set of sevens? No. I'll just go grab one. He did raise pre flop. He could have ace kings. Sugar non-sugar things or whatever sweetened.

[31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1867s) All right, I'm going to fold if I fight. Run it. Run it. Rabbit hunt. Let's see it. He's going back door regardless. World's easiest call. NO. OH MY GOD. WHAT? OH, he folded. He wanted the best hand by all. I knew it was coming. He's running so hot right now. I knew it was coming.

[31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1891s) You avoided the pain. Wow. I was like, you know what? I could live to fight another day here. That's second level play right there. Fear rewarded. Second level. The pros would have snapped the money. Fear rewarded. No, I mean, he's playing against me, so I would put him on a better hand playing against me. He knows I'm, you know, I play a tighter range of hands. So, good read.

[31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1913s) Yeah, it was the wrong read. King N. You're right. King nine of clubs was a little stronger than I thought. Pre flop. Yeah. He flips that over and you're like, I was like, "Oh god, that's gross." Right.

[32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=1934s) Run. We got to get sacks out here. Mhm. Guys, Molly Bloom's going to come in and say hi. Oh, cool. Oh, wow. Ace 10 versus Okay, guys.

Wait for the blind. You know, my favorite thing about tournament poker is when someone gets moved to a different table and you see them wandering around and looking for the table just trying and they got their tray of chips and they look and they see, oh, it's this seat, but it's about to be in the big blind.

[59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=3565s) Not many people do that, by the I've seen him turn and walk around and like pretend it wasn't the seat. 100% we see that doesn't happen that often. Ace 79. Still a chip lead, right? Wow. Take a I think I'm going to win, man. I I think I don't like this hand. I don't like playing against this. I think I'm going to win. No way. I actually think the kings are going to win. Kings are holding up for sure.

[59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4gaIGXaK4&t=3585s) Eight in the window. Yep. Eight. That's it. Eight. Eight. All right. Oh, good game.
