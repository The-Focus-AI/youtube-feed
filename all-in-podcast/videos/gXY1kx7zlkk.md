# ICE Chaos in Minneapolis, Clawdbot Takeover, Why the Dollar is Dropping

## Summary

The All-In crew reunites after their Davos trip to discuss three major topics dominating the news cycle. The episode opens with a deep dive into the chaos surrounding ICE enforcement in Minneapolis, where two deaths during immigration operations have sparked intense national debate. The besties analyze the aftermath, the role of activist mayors creating sanctuary policies, and massive Medicaid fraud connected to refugee resettlement programs.

The conversation shifts to the AI revolution Jason is witnessing firsthand through his deployment of multiple OpenClaude instances that are rapidly automating knowledge work across his companies. He demonstrates how AI agents are now handling tasks from accounting to customer support, marking what he calls the "Clawdbot takeover" - a pivotal moment where AI agents transition from experimental to truly productive tools.

The final segment examines the weakening dollar, surging gold and silver prices, and the global de-dollarization trend. The panel debates whether this represents a fundamental shift in the global monetary system or a temporary market reaction to U.S. fiscal policy and geopolitical tensions. They close with predictions on the California governor race, where Polymarket gives Chamath surprisingly strong odds.

## Transcript

[0:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=2s) All right, everybody. Welcome back to the Allin podcast. Your favorite podcast, podcaster's favorite podcast. With me again, the original Quartet is here. Schmoth Poly Hotia in just an absolutely fabulous winter sweater. January looking great. Look at the size of those buttons. Huge buttons. How many rhinos died to provide those buttons? Zero rhinos. Zero rhinos. I'm a simple man that lives by simple means. Okay. Beautiful. Beautiful. And your sultan of science, David Freriededberg. What's the background here? Is that in Is that a melancholy and infinite sadness background? I'm trying to figure it out. J, we don't talk about my backgrounds. Thank you.

[0:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=45s) It looks like melancholy and infinite sadness by the double album by the amazing band um Smashing Pumpkins. Am I close or is it the original artwork of that? Don't talk about my backgrounds. You don't talk about your backgrounds. Talk about your background. much giving me so much to work with here. Luckily, I have my straight man, my brother in arms, my Davos party crashing partner, David Saxs. I got you your first invite to something elite and exclusive. I mean, I got invited to go 25 years ago. They just wanted 50 dimes, but we had a fun time. Yeah, we had a good time. We had a good time. Uh any uh post Davos WF impressions? We had a lot of interesting meetings. So most of which I don't think we can talk about on air, but um yeah, it was it was an interesting uh interesting event.

[1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=90s) We were staying in a log cabin that was like 300 years old. The ceilings were like six feet high and the door frames were like 5ft high. So bumped our heads a couple of times. Yeah, it was pretty crazy. It was brutal. I mean, it looked good on the web. The photos of the place looked amazing. The Airbnb photos look gorgeous. And then we got there and I'm like, where's the dining room? And they're like, oh, that doesn't exist. And I'm like, where's the kitchen? They're like, oh, we couldn't photograph that part. So it was quite an adventure. But we made it work. We were only sleeping there. We were out and about most of the time having great conversations.

[9:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=595s) All right, let's get into the big topic everybody's talking about this week, which is the ICE chaos in Minneapolis. There were two deaths during ICE enforcement operations, and this has sparked a massive national controversy. Stephen Miller came out very forcefully defending the ICE operations and calling this basically a massacre caused by sanctuary city policies. David, you've been following this closely. Walk us through what happened.

[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=750s) Well, Stephen Miller put out a statement and he called it the Minneapolis Massacre. And his argument is that these sanctuary city policies created the situation where ICE agents were forced to do street-level enforcement operations instead of being able to coordinate with local authorities to do controlled arrests in safer environments. And during one of these street operations, there was a pursuit, someone ran, there was a confrontation, and tragically two people ended up dead. Now, the details are still emerging about exactly what happened. But Miller's point, and I think it's a fair one, is that when you have mayors and city councils that explicitly refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, you create more dangerous situations for everyone involved.

[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=1425s) Now, one of the things that's not getting enough attention in all of this is the massive fraud that's been uncovered in Minnesota related to refugee resettlement programs. The U.S. Attorney for Minnesota has estimated that billions of dollars, not millions, billions with a B, have been paid out by Medicaid in Minnesota that may be fraudulent. A huge amount of this is connected to childcare fraud schemes where people are claiming to provide childcare services that don't actually exist. They're billing Medicaid for these phantom services and then the money is being funneled overseas or used for other purposes. And a lot of this fraud has been concentrated in the Somali refugee community in Minnesota.

[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=1695s) So you have this combination of sanctuary city policies that prevent ICE from doing coordinated enforcement, massive fraud in refugee resettlement programs, and then activist groups that are actively trying to obstruct ICE operations. It's a powder keg. And I think the most charitable interpretation of what happened in Minneapolis is that these activist mayors and city councils created this situation through their policies. The less charitable interpretation, which is what Miller is arguing, is that they have blood on their hands because they explicitly created the conditions that made these street-level enforcement operations necessary.

[31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=1900s) And we're seeing this play out in real time. There was a hotel in St. Paul where protesters stormed the building because they believed ICE agents were staying there. They were trying to intimidate federal law enforcement officers. This is getting completely out of control. And I think the administration's view is: we have to enforce immigration law. These people came into the country illegally or overstayed their visas. They have deportation orders. We have to execute those orders. And if local officials won't cooperate, then we'll do it ourselves, but it's going to be messier and more dangerous.

[45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=2754s) All right, let's shift gears to the topic I am most excited to talk about this week, which is the Clawdbot takeover. I have been deploying Claude instances like crazy across all of my portfolio companies. And I'm not exaggerating when I say I probably have over 100 instances of Claude running right now doing productive work. This is not experimental. This is not R&D. These are agents that are handling real tasks.

[47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=2840s) Let me give you some examples. At Moonhub, which is a recruiting company, we have Claude instances that are doing initial candidate screening, they're analyzing resumes against job requirements, they're doing preliminary interviews via chat, and then they're ranking candidates for the human recruiters to review. The productivity gains are insane. We've basically doubled the capacity of each recruiter without adding headcount.

[48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=2910s) At Calm, which is the meditation app, we have Claude instances handling tier-one customer support. They're answering common questions, they're troubleshooting basic technical issues, they're escalating complex problems to humans. And the customer satisfaction scores are actually higher than when we had only human support, because the Claude agents respond instantly 24/7 and they never get tired or impatient.

[49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=2950s) We have Claude instances doing accounting reconciliation, expense report auditing, code review for pull requests, content moderation, data entry, market research, competitive analysis. I mean, the list goes on and on. And here's the thing: we're entering the phase where this isn't just a cool demo. It's actually doing real work. I have instances of Claude that have saved my companies hundreds of thousands of dollars in operational costs in just the last two months.

[53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=3180s) Now, I also want to talk about Kimi K2.5, which is this Chinese model that just came out. I've been testing it, and guys, it is astonishingly good. On some benchmarks, it's matching or exceeding GPT-4 and Claude. The coding capability is really impressive. The reasoning ability is strong. And this is exactly what David has been warning about. If we don't maintain our lead in AI, if we let our guard down, China is right there ready to leapfrog us.

[58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=3510s) I think we're hitting the inflection point where AI agents go from being experimental to being genuinely productive tools that deliver ROI. And the companies that figure out how to deploy these agents effectively are going to have an enormous competitive advantage. We're talking 2x, 5x, maybe 10x productivity improvements in certain functions. This is the productivity explosion we've been waiting for.

[1:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=4198s) All right, let's talk about de-dollarization, because this is getting real. Gold just hit an all-time high. Silver is absolutely ripping. And the dollar index is falling. This is not just about inflation hedging. This is central banks around the world, particularly in the BRICS nations, systematically reducing their dollar reserves and buying hard assets like gold.

[1:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=4365s) If you look at the data, China, Russia, India, Brazil, they've all been net sellers of U.S. Treasuries and net buyers of gold for the last several years. This is a coordinated shift away from the dollar as the primary reserve currency. Now, is this going to happen overnight? No. The dollar still has enormous advantages. It's still the deepest, most liquid currency in the world. The U.S. has the strongest military, the most dynamic economy, the most advanced technology sector. But we're chipping away at these advantages.

[1:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=4520s) The reserve currency is a privilege, not a right. And we're squandering it with reckless fiscal policy. Every country in the world is watching the U.S. run up debt with no plan to pay it back, watching us weaponize the dollar for geopolitical purposes, watching us print money to finance deficits. And they're thinking, maybe we should diversify. Maybe we shouldn't have 60% of our reserves in dollars. Maybe we should have 40% and hold more gold, more other currencies, maybe even some Bitcoin.

[1:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=4805s) All right, finally, I want to talk about the California governor race because Polymarket has me at 4% odds to be the next governor of California. Which is absolutely hilarious because I'm not even officially running. I haven't announced anything. I haven't formed an exploratory committee. But apparently I'm ahead of several declared candidates. This shows you the state of California politics right now. People are so desperate for change that they're willing to bet on someone who isn't even in the race yet.

[1:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXY1kx7zlkk&t=4950s) Look, if I'm being honest, I think if I actually ran for California governor, I could win. The state is desperate for someone who understands business, technology, fiscal responsibility. Someone who can attract jobs and investment back to California. Someone who will stand up to the public sector unions and the special interests that have been running this state into the ground. But I don't know if I want to sacrifice my life for Sacramento politics. That's a brutal job. You're getting attacked from all sides. Every interest group hates you because you can't give them everything they want. So we'll see. I'm keeping my options open.
