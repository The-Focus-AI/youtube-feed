# Bryan Johnson's Best Health Hack: Lower Your RHR Before Sleep = Sleep Better and Live Longer

## Summary

Bryan Johnson, who sold Venmo for $800 million and has spent a fortune on his quest to reverse aging, takes the All-In Summit audience through an interactive biological age test and then distills everything he has learned about health into one simple, actionable hack. He starts by having the entire audience stand on one foot with their eyes closed -- a balance test that correlates directly with biological age, where 15-30 seconds maps to age 20-40, 7-15 seconds to age 40-60, and 0-7 seconds to 60+.

Johnson then reveals what he considers the single most important health intervention from all his research: optimizing your resting heart rate before sleep. He explains that lowering your pre-sleep heart rate by 10% (e.g., from 60 to 54 bpm) dramatically improves sleep quality, which in turn improves willpower, mood, and overall health. His protocol is straightforward: eat your final meal 4 hours before bed, turn screens off 1 hour before bed, use amber/red lighting, stop caffeine by noon, and develop a wind-down routine.

The talk concludes with Johnson pushing back against the startup culture of grinding without sleep, arguing that sleep is the best performance-enhancing drug in the world, and framing "Don't Die" as the next major ideology for humanity on par with democracy and capitalism.

## Transcript

[0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=1s) True or false? You, Bryan Johnson, the man sitting across from me, one day, at some point, as of yet undefined in the future, you will die. False. Sold Venmo for $800 million. Has spent a fortune on a quest to stay young forever. Don't die is the general theme of what we're trying to do. It's humanity's only objective. None of us live forever except Bryan Johnson. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Bryan Johnson.

[0:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=50s) Hi guys. Okay, everybody stand up. What you're going to do is choose your left or your right foot. I'm going to count down from three and you're going to stay standing on your selected foot as long as you can with your eyes closed. Hands by your side. And those of you on the balcony, be careful. If somebody fell off, that'd be a bad situation. Okay. Foot selected. Let me pull out my timer. 5 seconds. 10 seconds. And your foot can't move. Stationary. 20. Okay, we'll stop there. Who's still up?

[2:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=124s) Stay up. This is a biological age test. As you age, part of your brain that keeps you well balanced atrophies and you can't maintain a balance very well. So, kids are very good at this. As you age, you get worse. So if you are between 15 and 30 seconds, that's roughly age 20 to 40. 7 to 15 seconds, you're between 40 and 60. And 0 to 7, you're 60 plus as an age category.

[3:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=200s) All right, you can take a seat. This is the neat thing about biological age testing. You of course know when you were born and therefore you know how many years you've lived. But actually in your body, your organs have different ages. Your lungs are a certain age, your brain, your eyes, your ears, your gums, your pancreas, your liver, they're all different biological ages. For example, I'm 47. My left ear is 64 years old. It's because I shot a lot of guns as a kid. I was right-handed like this with a lot of exposure in my ear. And I also listen to a lot of loud music. That's really important for me to know because when you have hearing loss and you don't correct for it with a hearing aid, it can result in cognitive decline.

[4:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=254s) And so a couple years ago, I posed this question. Are we really the first generation who won't die? It's kind of the coolest question in existence. What matters more than our experience, our ability to live? And so to do this, I wanted to do an experiment. I measured the biological age of every organ in my body. We then went through the scientific evidence and we tried to reverse and or slow down my speed of aging. And what I've been trying to do is create a sport or a new genre of what it means to be healthy. I put my biomarkers out and said, basically, I have the best biomarkers of anybody in the world.

[5:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=316s) Okay. So first, who got eight hours of sleep last night? 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. Thank you for your honesty. Two. One. Yeah, I appreciate that. Okay. Who has a confession to make? Who recently polished off a bag of chips, ate some ice cream, and then jammed some Twizzlers?

[5:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=356s) Okay, so you guys, the single best thing I've learned out of everything I've ever done is your resting heart rate before sleep is the best thing you can do for your health. Hands down. Here's what you're going to do tonight. Before you go to bed, get a baseline read with a wearable or just on your fingers on the neck. Lay down on your bed, take a few deep breaths. Find your resting heart rate. Let's say it's 60 beats per minute. Your goal over the next month is to lower your heart rate by 10% or so. So, if you're 60, be down to 54.

[6:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=391s) Here's how you're going to do it. If your bedtime's at 10 p.m., eat your final meal of the day at 6 p.m. After 6, no more food, no more snacks. By doing that, you allow your body to digest your food and your heart rate is going to go down. The reason why heart rate is so important is the lower your heart rate is, the better your sleep. The better your sleep, the better your willpower. Did you know if you don't sleep, your prefrontal cortex goes offline and you lose your willpower. So when you're trying to not eat the cookie, you're powerless. Sleep is the best performance-enhancing drug in the whole world.

[7:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=429s) So first thing is eat your final meal 4 hours before bed. Number two is you need to turn your screens off an hour before bed. We are all addicted to our phones, but that 1 hour is so important because you have to give your body ability to wind down. If you're scrolling or working, you're going to be in an aroused state which boosts your heart rate. Anything that boosts your heart rate before bed is going to be bad for you.

[7:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=455s) Three is you want to have amber and red lights in your house. No blues. You want to be mindful of your stimulants. Noon thereabouts is when you want to stop your caffeine intake because caffeine has roughly a 6-hour half-life. If you have a cup of coffee at 4 p.m., at bedtime a half a cup of coffee is in your system. And then finally you want to have some kind of wind-down routine where you read a book, go for a walk, do breath work, meditate.

[8:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=484s) Okay, now just be sober with me for a minute. I promise you this is the single best thing you can do for your health. And if we're honest, the majority of you in this room have some moderate to serious mental health challenges. Tell me I'm wrong. It's true. We are on our phones all the time. We don't sleep well. We eat junk food. It's very hard to take a moment to be healthy. I promise you, optimize your resting heart rate and it's going to be the very best thing you do for your mood. If you're experiencing anxiety or depression, high quality sleep is the thing. And culture that tells us right now that you have to grind and not sleep is a lie. It's a bad deal for you.

[9:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=558s) Who's going to commit to this? Who's not? So, I can shame you. Why are you not going to commit? "I'm a startup founder." Okay. This is it, you guys. Yes, you're a startup founder. The narrative is you have to martyr yourself, literally martyr yourself to achieve success. That is not true. You will be a better founder, parent, partner, whatever if you prioritize your sleep.

[9:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPISZI_big&t=594s) Don't die. Yes, it's about health. It's also the next major ideology for the human race. We are giving birth to super intelligence. Our ideas about reality are going to shift. Existence itself will be the highest virtue. Don't die is the next major ideology on par with democracy, capitalism, Christianity, Islam. It is the next thing we do as a species. So friends, be well. Go to bed on time. You committed? All right, guys. Be well.
