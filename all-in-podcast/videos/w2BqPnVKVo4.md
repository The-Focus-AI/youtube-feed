# The Future of Everything: What CEOs of Circle, CrowdStrike & More See Coming in 2026

## Summary

Jason Calacanis conducts four back-to-back CEO interviews from Davos 2026, exploring the future of money, cybersecurity, urban air mobility, and AI infrastructure. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire discusses the transformative impact of the GENIUS Act on stablecoins, predicting explosive growth as regulatory clarity enables mainstream adoption. He argues that stablecoins will become the "money layer" of the AI economy, with trillions in transaction volume as AI agents need programmable, instant settlement.

CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz explains why cybersecurity is more critical than ever in the AI era, identifying nation-state actors and AI-powered attacks as the primary threats. Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein provides an update on eVTOL progress, revealing that commercial operations could begin in select cities by late 2026. Crusoe Energy CEO Chase Lochmiller details how his company is solving the power challenge for AI training by locating data centers at stranded energy sources like flared natural gas and renewable curtailment.

The common theme across all four interviews is infrastructure - whether it's regulatory infrastructure for digital money, security infrastructure for AI systems, transportation infrastructure for urban mobility, or energy infrastructure for compute. These CEOs are building the foundational layers that will enable the next decade of technology innovation.

## Highlights

### "Stablecoins Will Be the Money Layer for AI Agents"

> "When you have billions of AI agents that need to transact value instantly, 24/7, across borders, you can't use the traditional banking system. Stablecoins become the obvious solution. They're programmable money with instant settlement. This is the infrastructure layer for the AI economy."
> — Jeremy Allaire, [28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2BqPnVKVo4&t=1680s)

### "China, Russia, North Korea - The Cybersecurity Threat Landscape"

> "The most capable hacker nations are China, Russia, and North Korea, in that order. China is playing the long game - they're in your systems for years, stealing intellectual property. Russia is more opportunistic and destructive. North Korea is motivated by revenue generation to fund their regime."
> — George Kurtz, [1:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2BqPnVKVo4&t=3753s)

### "eVTOLs Could Launch in Select Cities by End of 2026"

> "We're targeting commercial operations in select markets by Q4 2026. Not everywhere at once - but in cities where we have the infrastructure, regulatory approvals, and demand. This is the year eVTOLs go from concept to reality."
> — Adam Goldstein, [1:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2BqPnVKVo4&t=5273s)

### "We're Powering AI Training With Flared Natural Gas"

> "The AI buildout needs massive amounts of power. We're solving this by putting data centers directly at stranded energy sources - natural gas that would otherwise be flared, renewable energy that would be curtailed. We're turning waste into compute."
> — Chase Lochmiller, [1:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2BqPnVKVo4&t=6747s)
