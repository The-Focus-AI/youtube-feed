# Dr. Mehmet Oz on Fixing American Healthcare + Fraud | Live from Davos

## Summary

Jason Calacanis and David Sacks sit down with Dr. Mehmet Oz, the new Administrator of CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services), for an in-depth conversation about fixing America's healthcare system. Dr. Oz explains why he left his successful television career and surgical practice for public service - because CMS oversees $1.7 trillion in annual spending and touches the lives of 150 million Americans, making it the ultimate leverage point for healthcare transformation.

The conversation focuses heavily on fraud, which Dr. Oz estimates consumes 10-15% of all CMS spending - potentially $170-250 billion annually. He describes sophisticated criminal networks running fake clinics, billing for services never rendered, and exploiting lenient verification systems. California is highlighted as a particularly problematic state with an estimated $20-30 billion in annual Medicaid fraud, much of it connected to organized crime from overseas.

Dr. Oz also discusses Trump's vision for healthcare centered on three pillars: transparency (knowing what procedures cost), choice (ability to shop for care), and competition (providers competing on price/quality). The discussion touches on AI-enabled self-directed healthcare, the future affordability of GLP-1 drugs, immigration's impact on healthcare systems, and addiction treatment. Throughout, Dr. Oz emphasizes that fraud reduction and system efficiency can improve care while reducing costs - a rare win-win in healthcare policy.

## Highlights

### "$170-250 Billion in Annual CMS Fraud"

> "I believe 10-15% of CMS spending is fraudulent. That's $170 billion to $250 billion every single year. This is not a rounding error. This is more than we spend on many entire government agencies. And it's being stolen by organized criminal networks."
> — Dr. Mehmet Oz, [35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5p40OuTTW4&t=2106s)

### "California Has $20-30B in Medicaid Fraud Annually"

> "California's Medicaid fraud is estimated at $20 to $30 billion per year. Much of it is organized crime - Armenian gangs, Russian gangs, Chinese gangs - setting up fake clinics, billing for services never rendered. The state has basically no enforcement."
> — Dr. Mehmet Oz, [44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5p40OuTTW4&t=2642s)

### "Trump's Three Healthcare Pillars: Transparency, Choice, Competition"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5p40OuTTW4?start=206&end=266" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> "President Trump's vision is simple: transparency so you know what things cost, choice so you can decide where to get care, and competition so providers have to compete on price and quality. If we get those three things right, the market will fix a lot of our problems."
> — Dr. Mehmet Oz, [3:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5p40OuTTW4&t=206s)

### "AI Will Enable Self-Directed Healthcare"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5p40OuTTW4?start=806&end=866" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> "AI is going to democratize medical knowledge. Within a few years, you'll be able to describe your symptoms to an AI that knows your complete medical history and get diagnostic accuracy that rivals or exceeds most doctors. This will empower patients to direct their own care."
> — Dr. Mehmet Oz, [13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5p40OuTTW4&t=806s)

### "GLP-1s Will Become Affordable Through Competition"

> "Ozempic and Wegovy are expensive now, but competition is coming. You'll see multiple manufacturers, biosimilars, generics. Within 3-5 years these drugs will be a fraction of current cost. And if they prevent diabetes, heart disease, and obesity complications, they'll save the system money."
