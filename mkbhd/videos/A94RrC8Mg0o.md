# Nothing Headphone 1 Review: As Good as They Look?

## Summary

MKBHD reviews the Nothing Headphone 1, the company's first over-ear noise cancelling headphones at $300. Nothing has established itself as a design-focused company, and these headphones continue that tradition with a polarizing transparent aesthetic that's either loved or hated. Beyond the looks, MKBHD was pleasantly surprised to find the functionality is actually good. The "Sound by KEF" partnership delivers solid audio quality (he bought KEF's Mu7 headphones to compare and confirmed they're distinctly different products). Physical controls include a scroll wheel for volume, play/pause button, customization button, and Bluetooth pairing button - no touch controls. Battery life hits 35 hours, comfort is excellent for 8+ hour sessions, and ANC is "B+" compared to Sony's "A+". At $300, these compete favorably against the $450 Sony XM6s - the question is whether Sony's advantages are worth $150 more.

## Transcript

[0:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=2s) These are the Nothing Headphones 1. So, Nothing has become known as a design company. And that's not a bad thing, people love great design. But you can think of them as something like a fashion brand in the genre of consumer electronics. They've made a few phones where design is like their major selling point. They've also now made earbuds where design is their major selling point.

[0:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=32s) And now, this is their first pair of $300, over-ear, noise cancelling headphones. So now they're playing in like the premium headphone space where people usually buy based on their audio quality, the Sonys, the Boses of the world. And so these will obviously stand out because of this design, but is that enough?

[0:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=53s) Now, first of all, the design is polarizing so it may be enough for some people. There's a dark version and a light version. I've been rocking the light version. And yeah, it's very distinctive, like it sticks out glued to the side of your head. So there's nothing in the market that's going to look quite like it, which, you know, hey, that's the point.

[1:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=74s) Like all that means is some people are going to love it and some people are going to hate it because it looks different. I do think this is a bit more elegant than a Cybertruck, though. There's some text, there's this red dot, so you always know which ear is which. And then, of course, Nothing really likes the transparent aesthetic. And obviously, that's a challenge with headphones because all you'd really see is drivers and wires, but I still think they pulled it off and it looks neat. Is that crazy? Am I crazy for that?

[1:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=102s) But I do have a theory. I do think that this design was easier for me to accept because the rest of the headphones is actually pretty good.

[1:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=113s) Now, when I first saw that Nothing was making over-ear headphones, you know, I read the spec sheet and I got all the information about them, and one thing kind of stood out to me that you might have also seen in a keynote or whatever announcement which is, "Sound by KEF." Right, so these headphones are tuned by KEF, but obviously this is their first pair of these big, over-ear, premium headphones. So they've partnered with an audio company. I honestly don't know that much about KEF.

[2:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=140s) And my immediate reaction is, okay, how much of a brand deal is this really? So I went digging around KEF's website, and wow, they have a whole lineup of premium speakers. A few thousand dollars, a few tens of thousands of dollars. They've got bookshelf speakers, floor standing speakers. These things are $225,000.

[2:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=161s) But then, they did have, exactly, one pair of headphones on their site. One pair of wireless, over-ear, active noise cancelling headphones. These things are called the Mu7. Uh-huh. Is this one of those white-labeled OEM situations where Nothing just changed the design on the outside? That would feel kind of lame.

[3:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=183s) So I bought them. They were like 400 bucks on their site, but they're listed for $220 on Amazon, so that's where I got them. But I'm happy to report that, thankfully, they're almost nothing alike. I mean they sound similar enough, but if the premise is that KEF contributed like these drivers and just sound tuning and all the features around it, then I think they've done enough to make an entirely different product.

[3:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=208s) There's about five different physical controls on the Nothing Headphones 1. First of all, this top button here is actually also a slider, kind of like a mouse scroll wheel. So it's smooth, it goes back and forth, and it's volume up and down. But you can also press it to cycle through transparency and ANC modes, and then hold it down to turn them off and noise cancellation on.

[3:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=230s) I don't love that they make a sound when they switch modes. But that's already way better than those finicky, touch-sensitive areas we've seen on so many other headphones, so I'm down with it.

[4:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=241s) And then right below that, there's a play/pause button that's large enough and easy to find. And that is the next track and previous track button too. And in certain supported apps, it'll also actually let you hold down to scrub through audio. Confirmed this works in chunks in Spotify, but it also works I think best in like a 2x scrubbing through a podcast.

[4:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=262s) But then the bottom of the right headphone has the on/off switch, and the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. And then at the front of the right ear is a customization button. By default, pressing it once activates the voice assistant on whatever phone you've paired to. But in the Nothing app, you can actually customize what it does.

[4:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=281s) And then on the inside here is a subtle but useful Bluetooth pairing button. So no touch controls, only tactile, physical buttons and switches. Thumbs up to the control system.

[4:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=295s) And then they hit almost every other build quality fundamental too. These headphones are solid. The ear cups are a mix of metal, where you grab the headphones, but also plastic to save weight. And the headband is very flexible for a variety of head sizes. The ear cups are quite soft. They are a little warmer than completely plastic ANC headphones. They're not AirPods Max heavy. And they're still very comfortable for extended periods.

[5:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=322s) I know that because I just did a long flight with them. I had about eight hours of travel and I watched tons of videos and listened to music and podcasts, and I was impressed by how good they feel. And they did that all on one charge. The battery life is rated about 35 hours. Roughly, the average for this category.

[5:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=338s) And then when I didn't need ANC or when I had to talk to somebody, I could take them off like this and they pause automatically, which is not something they all do. The one miss is these headphones don't fold flat. So traveling with them, you know, that means the case is a bit bigger. And also, this zipper in the case is frustrating. I'm not just saying that from this one perfectly framed comparison to this perfect Sony case, but this is actually a common complaint that I'm confident will annoy other people too. Just watch other videos, I bet they also hate the zipper. Just a little thing.

[6:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=371s) Aside from that, though, as far as comfort and build quality, they've done a great job here.

[6:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=379s) So then, what about the sound? What if you are buying them for the sound? Well, I think you could do a lot worse. First of all, the ear cups, the pads here, are very soft, but also very thick. So when you put these on, the isolation from your environment, even without ANC, is really good.

[6:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=396s) So then you turn ANC on, and it does a great job with room noise and general white noise. Turn the music up, and that's all you're gonna hear. I will say on the extreme end, it's about a notch and a half behind the Sony flagships. I could still hear some plane engine noise where I'd never hear it with the Sonys. But it's definitely not a deal breaker. If the Sonys are an A+, these are a B+.

[6:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=418s) Transparency mode is a mixed bag. The AirPods Max and the Sony XMs are still the best here, and these kind of fall in the middle. I mean, functionally, they're fine. I can hear my environment. If people talk to me, I can hear them. But my own voice, maybe there's not enough mics inside, but my own voice is super muffled. It's not comfortable to have a conversation wearing these, so I ended up just taking them off.

[7:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=442s) And look, honestly, I don't think people will buy these just for the sound. Like I said, Nothing is a design company, but the sound by KEF and the drivers do perfectly fine thanks to the tuning. They're clear, they're well balanced all the way from bass to highs without distortion at high volumes. Not a particularly wide sound stage, but some may like that focused sound.

[7:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=468s) And you can dial in the exact sound profile you really like with the app. Matter of fact, let me show you the app real quick. This is where you can do a ton of stuff. You can change exactly what the customization button does with a single press or a press and hold. You can quickly manage which devices the headphones are connected to. And yes, they can be connected to multiple devices.

[8:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=486s) You can change the level of ANC from low to medium to high, and you can pick from a variety of EQ presets or go into the advanced one and literally drag the sliders around and make a preset for yourself. And there is a lot of range here. You can really mess up the sound or dial in something nice and subtle.

[8:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=506s) This might come as a surprise but these actually sound competitive with headphones that cost more. Now, part of that is because the really good headphones have moved up a bit in price. But I think that's the point. The price you'd expect to pay for a rock-solid pair of premium noise cancelling headphones with good sound, good build quality, USB Type-C audio, LDAC support, and a good, well-featured app is around $400 these days. And these are $300.

[8:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=539s) So can you get better headphones for more money? Yeah, of course. The Sony headphones I keep referencing, the XM6s, are still the best overall over-ear headphones, like they're better at basically everything. Better ANC, better sound quality. They fold, they have a better case. But are they $150 better? That's up to you.

[9:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=561s) I mean, some people will prefer the actual physical switches and buttons on these headphones over the Sonys. Some people might prefer this design over the Sonys, believe it or not. Some people are going to prefer the price over the Sonys. So that's where these come in.

[9:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=578s) And thanks to Insta360 for sponsoring this portion of the video. I checked out the X3 a while back and since then, they've made a couple of generational improvements to get to this X5. So this camera's got a 144% sensor size increase from X3. With the new sensor and PureVideo mode, the X5 excels now in low-light scenarios.

[9:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=599s) The X5 has the ability to shoot up to 8K 360 videos at 30 fps, 5.7K at 60 fps, or 4K at 120 fps. And as you know, the ultra-high resolution is important because you lose some quality when you're cropping and reframing. And now with their new Triple AI Chip system and InstaFrame mode, X5 can handle in-camera reframing in real-time, while simultaneously recording the full 360 for future flexibility.

[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=623s) The new battery life's impressive too, up to three hours of continuous recording. And the lenses have a tough, scratch-resistant coating. So for the first time in a 360 camera, they're replaceable if you damage them. Their free editing app makes it super easy to reframe footage and is packed with AI features to level up the quality of your edits, including full auto-editing and the ability to add effects.

[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=646s) Insta360 clearly set out to make the X5 the most powerful and versatile 360 camera ever. And all of these new features are paired with their waterproof design and their best-in-class stabilization. So check it out today. And the first 50 people who order will get a free replacement lens kit and invisible selfie stick.

[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A94RrC8Mg0o&t=667s) Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
