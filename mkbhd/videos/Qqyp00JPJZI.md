# Siri Isn't That Bad

**Channel:** [Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/@UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ)

## Summary

MKBHD reviews hot takes submitted by his audience on Twitter and Threads, rating each as either a "good take" or "bad take." The video covers five main hot takes: (1) humanoid robots are not the optimal form factor - which he agrees with, arguing specialized robots are more practical than general-purpose humanoid ones; (2) the Magic Mouse's bottom charging port is fine - which he disagrees with, noting it's an outdated design; (3) smartphones will be obsolete in 5 years - which he strongly disagrees with, saying the timeline is far too aggressive; (4) we should celebrate companies trying audacious things even if they fail - which he partially agrees with but warns against being too lenient; and (5) Siri isn't as bad as people make it out to be - which he surprisingly agrees with for basic tasks, though acknowledges it falls far behind competitors for anything requiring reasoning.

## Highlights

[0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=30s) Ah, hot takes. Internet hot takes. One of those gifts that always just keeps giving. I had a scalding hot take of my own recently. Actually, I literally can't picture an iPhone not having a mute switch. Like, sure, you can always do it with software, yes, but that I would bet anyone a million dollars right now that the next 5 years of iPhones will all have a mute switch because it's just such a part of the iPhone's design. Yeah. So, that was 2022 and some of you are realizing that immediately the next iPhone that came out, they replaced that mute switch with an action button.

[1:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=67s) So, clearly I was wrong. I don't know who I send that money to, but that's the beauty of the internet is the hot takes just live out there forever. So, I went on Twitter and Threads this past week and asked you guys for your hottest takes and got quite a few of them. Some of them kind of cold takes to be honest. But then some of them ranged all the way up to scalding hot borderline need to be institutionalized for it type of takes and I actually agree with some of them. Which is really fun. So let's just dig right into these, shall we?

[1:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=97s) Also before we do, a little merch shout out. It's I'm holding the mic because of the basement setup, but this new stuff is all finally live at mkbhd.com which is very exciting. So check it out. And also, I got to give a shout out every time I do one of these videos to Jimmy High Roller. He does these types of hot take videos with basketball takes. So, if you want to check out any of that stuff, I'll leave a link below the like button. They're always out there. Inspiration for this series.

[2:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=122s) But here we go. So, first take, humanoid robots are not the optimal form factor and are a bad idea. And damn. Okay, starting off pretty heavy with this one. And I think my default I think is that I agree with this one, but there's a whole section of people who are watching this who are already typing their comments about how much they disagree.

[2:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=146s) So humanoid robots have been in the news quite a bit recently. I mean they've been a thing for years from Boston Dynamics back in the day and they've gotten more and more advanced all the way up till now. You've probably seen my video on the Neo, which is a soft cloth little 60 lb humanoid chore robot thing. And it's true that humans forever have always like loved the idea or at least thought about fantasized about having humanoid robots live amongst them like from the Jetson's assistant all the way till you know what we see in these startups what they're trying to ship.

[2:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=178s) And the idea is that the world that we've built around us is designed for the human form. All the handles all the shapes all the spaces everything that we've made is designed to fit the human body which makes total sense. So if you want one multitasking robot that can do everything around you in your life, well then that robot should be human-shaped so it can sit right in and grab the same handles and move the same stuff that a human would.

[3:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=205s) The logic is there, but I think the more you think about it, the other side of that logic becomes way more convincing, at least to me, which is that you are unnecessarily inheriting all of the limitations of the human form. So, it's kind of cool that you can build like an upright bipedal robot that balances on two feet and walks around and grabs stuff, but like here's this example.

[3:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=227s) The self-driving car is perfect, right? Like, do you want a car that you can put your humanoid robot in that can drive it, or do you want the car itself to be the robot? Having a humanoid robot that drives and also has blind spots and also can't see behind it and also can't see all the places humans can't see is not a good idea. But the car being the robot and having sensors and cameras on the front and the back and the sides and reviewing all those things at the same time is clearly a better driver.

[4:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=255s) So really there's just a fork of only two possible futures that you believe in with robotics. Either we will have humanoid robots that can do all of the tasks that humans don't want to do anymore. And since it's humanoid shaped, it can fit into human places and it can do the coffee by using the coffee maker. And then it can do the laundry and vacuum and do all these load the dishes. It can do everything the way a human could.

[4:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=285s) Or each one of those appliances is the robot and the coffee maker makes the coffee by itself and the dishwasher loads the dishes by itself and the vacuum is a little Roomba on the ground. And all these things that your humanoid robot could do are now just being done by a specialized robot on their own. And I tend to think that that second one feels like the more likely future. I'm not an expert clearly, but that's what I think.

[5:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=310s) Even if it is one robot that goes around everywhere that does everything, why not give it six arms and six legs? Like, why does it have to look like a human and have eyes on the front? That's all I'm saying. Anyway, I think this is a good take.

[5:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=322s) So, all right. Next take is that the bottom charging port on the Magic Mouse is just fine. Okay. So, the Magic Mouse originally came out in 2009, believe it or not. That was when I was in high school. I'm 31 now. It's been a long time. But this was, you know, a really cool, slim, ultra beautiful mouse. It's the first multi-touch mouse for the Mac. And it had double A batteries on the bottom. So, if you ever had the batteries die, you just pop the batteries out and replace them and it would last one to two months on a charge.

[6:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=364s) So, then in 2015 when they finally updated the Magic Mouse, this is now when I'm a senior in college, they updated it with rechargeable batteries in the bottom so you could recharge it and they put that lightning port to recharge the mouse on the bottom of the mouse, which instantly made it one of the most memeable weird products of all time from Apple. But again, it would last about a month on a charge. And similar to a lot of other products, so you don't really have to charge that often.

[6:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=388s) If you ever did need to charge it, you could plug it in for like 5 minutes and get a couple hours of use out of it. So, if your mouse ever did die, you could flip it over and plug it in and it would be useless for 5 minutes and then you could go back to using it and then remember to charge it overnight to get the full zero to 100. It would only take like 2 hours.

[6:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=406s) So, you know, that does mean that the absolute worst case scenario would be like you're in the middle of doing something very important and your mouse dies. So, you flip it over and plug it in for 5 minutes while you wait for it to charge up and then you're good to go, which doesn't seem that bad in a vacuum, but we're not in a vacuum.

[7:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=429s) And that's very important to realize that every single other mouse probably ever made has found a way to charge it while you continue to use it. And that's the reason the Magic Mouse is so ridiculous. And really just the fact that the Magic Mouse's design still now in 2025 hasn't changed since I was in high school and it's still like $80 and it still has all the downsides it has from all those years ago is crazy to me.

[7:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=455s) It's wild that Apple is a multi-trillion dollar company and hasn't updated it. Maybe they'll make a new mouse someday soon, but as of right now, I cannot say that this is a good take. It's a bad one.

[7:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=467s) Okay, so within 5 years, smartphones will be obsolete. And well, that is definitely a hot take, but it does feel like there is an entire chunk like a section of Silicon Valley that is dedicated to hedging their bets against this take. Like when you hear Meta talk about smart glasses, the way they talk about it, they really see it as potentially the next big computing platform.

[8:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=495s) And they constantly describe a world where you spend way less time on your phone and you move on to doing most of your interaction with computing and the world around you through these AR glasses and similar vibes from a lot of other standalone AI device companies which a lot of them have failed but the idea is still that you start to use your phone less and less and move on to this new thing.

[8:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=516s) So you can see how someone would think like okay we are starting to see the seeds of like the next big computing platform from a smartphone everywhere around us and it's just a matter of time before one of them really grows and blossoms and catches on and everyone stops using their phones.

[8:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=532s) So I get it. But the reason this take is so crazy hot is 5 years. 5 years is a ridiculously short amount of time just as far as the life cycle of these major technologies go. That would be crazy if people stopped using their phones in 5 years. I don't know if you realize how popular smartphones actually are right now if you think they'll all be obsolete in 5 years.

[9:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=553s) Like this actually reminds me of one of the hot takes from last time or like 2 years ago I did this video and someone's take was that the Cybertruck would outsell the Ford F-150 by 2026 which that obviously aged poorly. But you know it didn't seem like that crazy of a take because the Cybertruck had all this hype and it had like a million pre-orders but people don't realize how popular the Ford F-150 actually is. It's been the number one bestselling truck in America for like 46 years straight or something like that.

[9:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=581s) And I feel like this take all it does is just underestimate the popularity of smartphones today. So, you know, maybe there is an explosion of these next AI devices or smart glasses or headsets or whatever it is in the next couple of years. That is totally possible. But smartphones being obsolete in that time, that's going to take a way longer time. Even in the most optimistic futuristic version of things, I think 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, maybe I could see it. But yeah, smartphones still are kind of OP. Bad take.

[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=618s) Okay, we should celebrate companies big and small trying audacious things. Even if they sell it before it's ready, even if they fail, we need to celebrate companies taking moonshots and not measure everyone on immediate ROI. Huh, this one, this one feels targeted. Is this the Humane burner account?

[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=635s) So, this one I think I can break down pretty simply. Like I've seen this take or this position or this sentiment many times before actually that basically we need to be more generally accepting of companies trying new things because on one hand so much tech is reductive nowadays. It's all boring. It's all the same as the year before. So when a company actually tries something new we should always celebrate that like that should get a round of applause and we should be very excited about it instead of shooting it down before we get a chance to see if it blossoms or not in the future. It might not have amazing success out the gates, but congrats on trying the new thing. Totally valid.

[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=672s) But I would just say you should also be careful with how far you want to push that sentiment because this is it's very popular in like the corners of like tech optimist Twitter and things like that where yes, you want to be positive about things, but I, for example, as a reviewer, I'm always looking at things from the lens of should you buy it, should you spend your money on it today?

[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=696s) And I did that video not that long ago about the problem with these devices that are shipping before they're ready. It's impossible for me to tell you to buy something before it's ready. I mean, that's one of the core tenants of like how I recommend things is don't buy it based on the promise of future software updates. So, I'm not going to be changing my stance on buying things that aren't ready. There is a section of people that's already very optimistic about every future tech and that's a totally valid place to come from. So this is a good take, but be careful. Be very careful.

[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=733s) All right, Siri. Siri isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Oh man, Siri not as bad as people. Okay, I want to be so specific with this take. It is a hot take. Obviously, I want to separate this into how bad is Siri for real for real. And also, how bad do people really make it out to be?

[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=756s) Because let's be real, there's been a million advancements in AI assistants over the past few short years, like Google's Gemini getting way better, more capable, and faster, and ChatGPT, but also Amazon's new Rufus AI powered assistant. And of course, all the game-changing advancements with LLMs that aren't even necessarily assistants. People use Claude and Perplexity and ChatGPT all the time for all kinds of stuff.

[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=779s) These things have, you know, in the past few years become super high usage tools and have changed the landscape of business of commerce of products and software and the things that we use every day. Like, it's blown up. It's so different than it was 5 years ago. So, you would think that a multi-trillion dollar company slash leader in the tech space that is Apple Inc. would be right in the mix in the thick of it. But it doesn't feel that way at all. It feels like they're very much watching from the sidelines.

[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=809s) So, here's my take on this. I've been thinking about this for a minute and I went back and, you know, I have Siri, obviously. I've been playing with this assistant for the better part of a decade now. And Siri is bad, okay? But it is actually pretty functional at like the extreme basics, right? When you're just asking a simple factual based question like, "What is the weather in Raleigh?" "It's currently clear and 47 degrees."

[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=838s) Okay, so like a super basic one-part question, no logic or thinking involved. Siri can typically do okay at that. And it even used to be way worse. It's like I would ask things and it would go let me check that for you or let me here's what I found and it would like pull up a wiki article or like it would Google something and it would be terrible. It's actually gotten better at this stuff. So that's good.

[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=859s) And then it can also do things local on the device, especially on the iPhone pretty well. It can send messages. It can open apps. I can go play "Illamerica" by Wolfgang Gartner on Spotify and it hears that "by Wolfgang Gartner now playing on Spotify" and actually starts it and plays it in Spotify. Like it's doing multi-step stuff and understanding what I'm saying locally on the iPhone. Also, things like home automation, if you have HomeKit stuff, that works. Okay.

[14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=894s) So, so, so all that to say, if that is all you use Siri for, if all you do is have it send a few messages, open some apps, Google some quick facts once in a while, then you can say that Siri isn't as bad as people make it out to be because it does everything you want. It seems like it's gotten better over the years if that's all you do.

[15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=919s) But obviously the second you ask it to do anything that's a little bit more advanced, anything that involves any type of reasoning or more than one step, that's when it instantly tries to kick it out to ChatGPT. So if I ask it to draft a quick email to my colleagues to say, "Thanks for a great day." "I'll need to use ChatGPT to write that. Should I go ahead?" And then it tries to kick it out. No. So don't don't don't just don't.

[15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=943s) So, like the integration into kicking out to other more capable assistants that are not Siri is fine. It's like a band-aid patch for now, but that's where all these brewings have been about this need for a better Siri for a long time. Like, it's abundantly clear that Siri has shortcomings. And if you're going to ever take those things upon yourself and make Siri better, Apple's going to have to make some moves. And there's been all these articles about moves that Apple is making behind the scenes. Maybe there's a big update coming, but we haven't seen it yet.

[16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=974s) I'm really sorry for probably accidentally triggering the Siri on whatever iPhone you have in the room with you many times during this video. It's my bad.

[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=984s) So I really end up kind of feeling just like the Magic Mouse take where like in a vacuum it seems fine but the second you are not in a vacuum anymore you see how much better everything else outside is and you realize how bad it is. That's the Magic Mouse and that's Siri. So, for the masses of people who have gotten used to not really doing much with their virtual assistants, which is a lot of iPhone users who just use it to send a couple messages, open an app, play some music, figure out what a song is, playing very basic tasks, then it doesn't seem like it's as bad as they say.

[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=1025s) So, as crazy as it sounds to say out loud, I guess that is a good hot take. It's impressive. That is truly impressive, internet commentator, for getting me to say nice things about Siri. But if you have other hot takes, I want to hear them. Let me know in the comments section below. It might be fun to gather some of those for the next video.

[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=1040s) You know what isn't a hot take, though? The fact that there is a ton of interesting stuff happening right now with channel partner. Watch this. So, I'll explain this in a second, but first, it's Ridge's biggest sale of the year with up to 47% off almost everything on their site.

[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=1056s) So, I've been using compact wallets for years now. In fact, I helped Ridge design this one, the Biflex. So, if you're still using a huge bulky wallet like this, it is a great time to upgrade. And Ridge has been making these minimal wallets for over a decade, and they keep refining them. So, the new Ridge Wallet 2.0 is 10% lighter and more modular. And it comes with their industry-leading built for life warranty. So, if you lose it or it gets stolen, you're covered.

[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=1081s) And Ridge is also getting into tech, which is sick. So, remember that car that I pinged earlier? That's their Find My card, which you can track anywhere, put it in your wallet, and you can see your wallet's location on a map anywhere that it is, and if you're close enough to it, play a sound. Super handy.

[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=1094s) Also, their 5-in-1 battery bank is also super popular as they've sold out multiple times this year. But it's MagSafe compatible. It has two built-in cables, a kickstand for watching videos while you charge, and you can even charge your Apple Watch with it.

[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqyp00JPJZI&t=1108s) So, if you've been putting off upgrading your everyday carry or want a great gift, then now is the best time. Head over to ridge.com/mkbhd and save up to 47% for a limited time. Thanks for watching. Again, let me see some hot takes in the comments below.
