# Google Pixel 10/Pro/Fold Impressions: Magnets!

## Summary

MKBHD delivers his first hands-on impressions of Google's entire Pixel 10 lineup, including the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The video highlights two major additions to the base Pixel 10: triple cameras (finally!) and Pixelsnap (Google's Qi2 magnetic charging system). While the Pro models offer incremental improvements over the base model, the real story is Google's continued focus on being the "smartest phone in the room" through AI-powered features like Magic Cues and Conversational Editing in Google Photos, rather than chasing spec-sheet dominance.

[0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=1) All right, they're finally here, the new big 10th-generation and I've got your first hands-on. First off the plane, by the way. I'm recording this after, back from Chengdu, China, where we just won gold with Team USA in Ultimate Frisbee at the World Games. The games were incredible. The team was incredible. And so, if for the next couple of months I use this massive gold medal sorry in advance, I can't help it.

[0:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=34) So there were big hopes and expectations for this Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. They've been showing us the design on social media for weeks that has the potential I will say, though, I actually do like the Pixel 10s' designs. At this point, the camera so they're keeping that. But then this build is and high-quality than ever before. It's still IP68-rated, but now and it's in these four colors: Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Lemongrass. It has a nicely upgraded top speaker. It has a brighter 3,000-nit display. They've matched, actually, with the metal color.

[1:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=80) But then the two biggest things, which both technically triple cameras and Pixelsnap. So, triple cameras. I wasn't actually sure if because we saw the leaks, and I wasn't sure if But it turns out they are finally doing triple cameras in the base Pixel. So we have here a a 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and a 10-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. So that's great, and we'll get to the

[1:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=109) But these phones all also which is basically Google's branding word for finally including Qi2 built into the phone. Wow! I actually didn't see that coming, but I'm very excited about it. This is one of literally two phones now that I've ever held in my hands that has the full Qi2 the other one being that very few people have ever heard of.

[2:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=139) But I'm so happy to see it here because it means you can at 15 watts. And there's also now of magnetic accessories that can slap onto the back of the phone, wireless chargers and stands of course, but even non-chargers like this Pixel Ring stand they're making. And it is, like, firm to which is awesome. And yes, iPhone MagSafe accessories do line up with these Qi2 magnets. So basically, any accessory out there that will lock onto the back of an iPhone will also lock onto the

[2:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=173) So Google is, of course, gonna be selling this $40 Pixelsnap charger. It's just a metal puck; you And the Pixelsnap Ring is $30, and it is actually pretty at a bunch of different So, for all intents and purposes, Pixelsnap is basically MagSafe. It's great. We'll take it.

[3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=195) So you might be thinking, "Marques, if the base Pixel is so good and it's got the triple cameras now and it's got Pixelsnap then what's new with the Pros? Like, is there anything And this has been a theme with the Pixel, which is that there isn't between the base Pixel and the Pro Pixel to justify the price. And that's kind of true again here. So let's play spot the differences.

[3:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=219) So both these phones are the same size: 6.3 inches on the base, But the Pro's display is and slightly brighter, and it's LTPO with a full instead of 60-to-120 on the base. You also get more RAM and max storage, and it actually has a likely to make room for the

[4:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=244) So, same focal lengths, but now this time: 50-megapixel main camera, and a 48-megapixel 5x telephoto. So with the extra resolution you can zoom in further, all the way into 100x, And Pro Res Zoom will and try to process and sharpen what it thinks you're taking a picture of, where you can only go And the Pros come in

[4:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=274) Now, how much better are the than the base phone's triple cameras? We'll see, you know? And also, does the extra Is the better selfie camera These are things that I have So definitely get subscribed to be among the first to But at this point, doesn't seem like there's between the base Pixel

[4:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=298) Now the 10 Pro XL is a because then you're also getting a bigger display, of course. Also, a bigger battery, double the starting storage as well. And it actually charges a little more thermal room, so And they gave it Qi2.2, so it will wirelessly charge But that's basically it.

[5:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=322) So the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 and they are the same as last year. So 799, 999, and 1,199.

[5:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=334) And then there's the foldy one. So we have the Pixel 10 because we get to see now that Google has learned along the way. They've made a first-generation foldable. Okay, so now what are What are they gonna settle that they keep and the things And this one is again for sure more flagship-y than last year, but not in a way that's gonna just a definite solid

[6:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=365) The most important piece, got the most work. It's this new gearless hinge, it makes that left-side leaving the outside screen feeling much more just like instead of being slightly So now it's a great phone to use closed. It's a slightly bigger the same 20-by-9 aspect ratio. It's a 60-to-120Hz refresh rate, and it's up to 3,000 nits

[6:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=393) So this for sure feels like And it's now IP68 dust- which I believe is the first be fully dust- and water-resistant. So shoutout to the hinge engineers, the hinge-gineers, for

[6:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=411) So then I unfold it, and eight-inch interior display. Nothing too dramatically different here. There's still a somewhat it's not terrible through The battery is a little bit bigger now: 5,000 milliamp-hours. That's nice to see. And yes, it also still has Pixelsnap, so Qi2 15-watt wireless Love that.

[7:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=436) Tensor G5. 16 gigs of RAM. Up to a terabyte of storage. And roughly the same triple It's a 48-megapixel primary but then the same and 10-megapixel ultra-wide with macro. It's all in a package than last year's. And the price is also the same: 1,799. And it comes in some nice,

[7:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=460) So it's interesting. I like it. But I do also have to admit it doesn't really do anything Like, it's not offering some The hardware is not incredibly thin or some crazy lack of a It doesn't have super-fast charging. It doesn't have incredible cameras. It doesn't really do I mean, IP68 is pretty

[8:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=488) But really, it's a Pixel. And that's the thing that matters. Like, the slightly more is one thing that Google's been slowly getting better at over the years. But massive numbers on paper They've never had a 100-megapixel camera or 100-watt charging. But instead, the Pixel of being the "smartest" phone in the room by just having a ton of really

[8:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=514) And they've added some stuff this year that strikes me as stuff that because it's using just Like, the two that really and Conversational Editing.

[8:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=528) So Magic Cues very cleverly from across different services to surface information So example, you're texting someone, and they ask you where in New York is. When Google Messages detects that, it surfaces this little rainbow cue with the answer to the since you got an email to answer that question when you booked. So you can just tap it and have it send the Very convenient.

[9:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=562) Or say your friend asks you to call United to change your flight 'cause they can't do it Okay, well, it knows So it surfaces that for you. And then when you call, it with your flight information the confirmation number, and everything, so you can talk about it. That is incredibly convenient. This is the type of because they know so much about you. They know all of your emails; they know when all of your and calendar events This isn't new; this is in little convenient

[9:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=599) But then the other thing, this was pretty crazy. I knew we were gonna get here eventually. I just didn't know when or But the idea is, you how to use the photo You can just talk to your

[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew&t=618) So like, let's say you of your parents, and oh, man, it would just if he wasn't holding So okay, type into that box at the bottom, or just say, or literally ask Then give it a few seconds, and back with this AI-based it pops up your new photo
