# Sarah Paine — How Imperial Japan defeated Tsarist Russia & Qing China

## Summary

Sarah Paine, professor at the US Naval War College, delivers a masterful lecture on how Japan -- with a population of just 47 million -- defeated both China (400 million) and Russia (130 million) to become Asia's dominant power at the turn of the 20th century. Her thesis is that the reversal of the Asian balance of power was driven by three factors: Japan's comprehensive Westernization of its institutions during the Meiji reforms, its mastery of grand strategy integrating diplomacy, information, military, and economics (DIME), and its skill at identifying the "culminating point of victory" -- knowing when to stop fighting and start negotiating.

The lecture covers the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), where Japan defeated the Chinese army and navy in paired battles, and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), where Japan executed a surprise attack on Port Arthur, fought a grueling campaign up the Liaodong Peninsula, and achieved one of the most lopsided naval victories in history at the Battle of Tsushima. Paine presents both her thesis and a strong counterargument -- that China's internal collapse from civil wars, European imperialism, and Manchu dynastic decline was the primary cause -- before arguing that clever decisions in Tokyo, combined with Russia's arrogant incompetence, were the decisive factors. The extended Q&A covers parallels to Pearl Harbor, why nobody assassinated Stalin, Europe's institutional future, and lessons for US grand strategy today.

## Highlights

### "Japan's defeat of China detonated the Confucian world order"

> "When Japan proved to the Chinese that they can't be better than China -- this effect on China was far more devastating than any Western defeat. The Chinese could write off Western victories as irrelevant. But Japan's victory basically detonated the Confucian world order. The Chinese have been trying to find a replacement ever since."
> -- Sarah Paine, [3:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=192s)

### "The Trans-Siberian Railway created Japan's three-year window for empire"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxIeJjEGLdo?start=926&end=980" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> "Japan understood exactly what the Trans-Siberian Railway was. Once Russia completes this thing, Japan can no longer be the dominant Asian power because Russia will be able to project military force directly into the theater. Japan had a window of opportunity that would slam shut."
> -- Sarah Paine, [15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=926s)

### "General Nogi's poem: Wars bring much sorrow"

> "Imperial troops, a million strong, But siege and field warfare left them desolate. Ashamed, what face can I show? How many men have returned? Wars bring much sorrow."
> -- General Nogi's poem, read by Sarah Paine, [48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=2900s)

### "Russia's cooperative adversary problem"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxIeJjEGLdo?start=4550&end=4610" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> "A cooperative adversary is not one that wants to cooperate with you, but one that cooperates with your strategy even though they're trying to win. Like playing chess with a little child -- they're trying to win, they just don't know how. Russia was Japan's cooperative adversary."
> -- Sarah Paine, [1:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=4550s)

### "If you're not willing to change your mind, you're just stupid"

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxIeJjEGLdo?start=5270&end=5330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> "You may not know the answer. I don't care who's right. I care what's right. If you're not willing to change your mind, you're just stupid. It's incredible the number of people who believe their only option is their current opinion."
> -- Sarah Paine, [1:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=5270s)

## Transcript

[0:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=44s) I'm going to talk to you today about one of the great generations of all times. They are the Meiji generation. That generation transformed Japan into the first non-Western power to fully Westernize its institutions. The second great generation of Japanese history is the post-war generation that transformed Japan into an economic superpower. I'm going to ask a question: What caused the reversal of the balance of power in Asia? Historically China had always been the dominant power. Then upstart Japan winds up overthrowing that order and it reverses and has profound effects even to this day when there's an ongoing reversal threatening to put Japan back in its box.

[2:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=131s) If you think about China back before the First Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese believed that their civilization was the best. They believed it was the richest country on earth. Incredible achievements in every domain. Also there was another assumption -- that civilization always moves forward towards Chinese civilization. Every other society is on the road to becoming Chinese. Japan's victory proved to the Chinese that there could be at least two civilizations out there.

[3:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=192s) This effect on China was far more devastating than any Western defeat. The Chinese could write off Western victories -- "they're barbarians, they're irrelevant to us." But Japan's victory basically detonated the Confucian world order. The Chinese have been trying to find a replacement ever since. For a while they thought it was communism. Maybe capitalism is the answer now. So why did the Asian balance of power change? I'm going to say, clever decisions in Tokyo.

[3:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=232s) I use a methodology from the Naval War College where students are required to write a thesis, then the best argument against it -- the counterargument -- and then a rebuttal. You need to hear out the counterargument because what you'll often find out is there are actually some very valid points in it that require you to adjust your own argument.

[7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=420s) The Japanese -- when they studied Western powers -- concluded that you cannot have the technology without the institutions. Modernization means adopting Western institutions: educational, legal, economic -- not just military technology. There are a lot of fighters in the Middle East who use state-of-the-art technology, but the last thing they want is Western institutions. The Japanese decided the answer was no, you can't have one without the other.

[15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=926s) Japan understood exactly what the Trans-Siberian Railway was. Once Russia completes this, Japan can no longer be the dominant Asian power. Treaty revision with the West is completed in 1899. Nine days later, Japan fires the opening shots of the Sino-Japanese War. There's a window of opportunity defined by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance on one side and the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway on the other.

[30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=1842s) The Russo-Japanese War starts with a Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur -- remarkably parallel to Pearl Harbor four decades later. But unlike Pearl Harbor, Japan had pre-positioned its mediation strategy. Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi was already arranging for Theodore Roosevelt to mediate before the first shot was fired.

[45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=2700s) Russia sent its entire Baltic Fleet around the world to fight Japan. There was no air conditioning. By the time they arrived, the crews were mutinous and the ships covered in barnacles. The Battle of Tsushima was one of the most lopsided naval battles in human history. Japan destroyed basically the entire fleet.

[49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=2962s) Here's the counterargument: maybe Japan was clever, but actually China faced problems so severe that any competent power could have stepped in. China was suffering civil wars -- the Taiping Rebellion may have killed 20-30 million people. European imperialism was carving up the country. And the Manchu dynasty was in terminal decline.

[1:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=3615s) Russia was actually on track to become the dominant Asian power. Their population was so much bigger. Had it not been for the Bolshevik Revolution, they would have had a 4x bigger population than Japan. They had more modern industry than Japan. But Japan, seeing this, acts early. That's the whole strategic logic.

[1:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=4510s) In both Pearl Harbor and Port Arthur, Japan is seeing an imminent strategic threat and a closing window of opportunity. The difference is that in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had limited objectives and a plan for how to end the war. In World War II, they had unlimited objectives and brought in the US, Britain, and half the world as adversaries.

[1:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=5687s) The Meiji generation dies before the military disasters of World War II. It didn't have to be this way -- if Itō Hirobumi had lived longer, the whole trajectory of history might have changed. On so many human endeavors, you can't rerun the experiment. When you're doing things in the here and now, you need to be ready for the counterargument, or it just doesn't exist.

[1:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxIeJjEGLdo&t=6460s) Where would the United States send a fact-finding delegation today? Start with our allies. I can't see that ever happening in the current climate. We're in the process of dismantling these relationships. Make them fear you, but don't make them hate you -- Machiavelli. If you're running around serially spitting in people's faces, those memories are long-term. It's unwise. Europe is going to lead the West if we abandon it, because they have the extensive set of institutions to do it.
