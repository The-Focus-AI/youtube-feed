# The Internet's Favorite Waxed Jackets, Ranked.

## Summary

Michael from The Iron Snail presents a comprehensive ranking of 16 waxed jackets after polling his audience to determine their favorites. He covers the history of waxed canvas, which originated in the seafaring world when sailors used linseed oil on sails and clothing for weather protection, later brought to land use by John Barbour for farmers, countrymen, and hunters.

The video progresses from unranked jackets (Devium, Ginew, Tom Beckbe, Iron & Resin, Dehen 1920 Crissman) through the officially ranked favorites: Bradley Mountain, Rogue Territory (27% of votes), Freenote Cloth (38 votes), Filson, Huckberry Flint and Tinder (96 votes, worn by Pedro Pascal in The Last of Us), and finally Barbour crushing the competition with 186 votes. Michael emphasizes that comfort and fit are the most important factors - jackets like Barbour and Filson rank highly because they provide room to move without fabric stress.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=0s) You've definitely seen these before. This sleeve opening right here. Jackets like this, like the Filson Cruiser for example, are really just shirts that got bigger and thicker over time and then they became a jacket. This carried over from shirts because if you have a nice button-up shirt on, button-down shirt, you're going to work, you're going to do something gross, you're going to roll your sleeves up. If it's hot, you're going to roll your sleeves up. There's a ton of reasons to roll your sleeves up.

[0:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=21s) But Filson does something extra which I really like. There's nothing wrong with this, but if you've ever worn a jacket like this in inclement weather, denim jacket, something like that, you know wind comes in right here. So does rain, snow, sleet, whatever it may be. I'm not Papa Filson, so I can't say this for sure, but it does seem like they did this part intentionally. First thing you'll notice, obviously, just the sleeve is cut a little bit differently. You can't see the seam here. But second thing, there's more jacket to go around. So if we have wind, sleet, snow, whatever it may be, they cut the sleeve. So we have this excess flap of fabric right here that helps protect a little bit more.

[0:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=54s) Wax canvas has a very cool history. Starting off in the seafaring world, wax canvas was a big deal because, well, it wasn't wax canvas, but people were putting linseed oil on sails and they were like, "Wow, our ship is sailing so much faster. This is great. We should put it on our clothes so we can run faster from the sea monsters." I don't know what they actually said when they discovered it, but basically they called it oil skins. They put linseed oil and then paraffin wax and so on and so forth on their clothing and it was great against the wind and rain.

[1:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=82s) And then a man named John Barbour said, "Hey, how come all the sailors and guys out at sea are getting this fabric and people that have farms and countrymen and hunters don't? I think they'd really like it." So, he made some jackets out of it. And guess what? They freaking loved it. And obviously nowadays, we see wax cotton basically everywhere. On motorcycle jackets, on rider jackets, on type three jackets, on jackets that should, you know, there's no real purpose to them besides that they look awesome. We see them absolutely everywhere. And we'll be seeing 16 of them today.

[1:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=107s) I asked you, the internet, what your favorite wax jacket was and why. And then I bought basically as many as I could, which was essentially all of them. Obviously, a lot of you said the same brand. So, what I did with those responses was just tally them up so that way we can see what the internet's favorite wax jacket actually is.

[2:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=125s) Devium. Before we get to Devium, I just wanted to say there's a few jackets. Well, also first need to say this bag is like 50 lbs. So, I was trying to film the whole video in one go in the woods. No go, Michael. You're not a Navy Seal. Also, Devium. A lot of you have been messaging me about Devium because it's a 100% made in USA brand. So, you want to see what I thought about it. I had no idea. I saw some Instagram ads from them but never checked them out.

[2:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=147s) This is the Overdrive waxed canvas jacket. And if you really like the Huckberry Flint and Tinder waxed trucker jacket, got to put this on the list. 9 and 12 ounce waxed canvas jacket. You could toss it on in most climates. Wherever you live, this won't be too hot or too cold. The build quality is good. It's very, very wide on the back and very wide on the chest. And the pleat in the back actually do a really good job of slimming this jacket down, but keeping a lot of excess fabric there. And that's what I mean when I say the jacket's for absolutely everybody. You could toss on a big sweatshirt if you live on the East Coast in Maine where it's still like 40 degrees. Or if you live in LA or California, you could just wear this on its own and you'll still be comfortable.

[3:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=198s) Ginew, a brand I was very curious about for multiple reasons, but one of them being this price tag. Ginew is a brand I really wanted to look at. One, because the embroideries are crazy, but two, because I saw on the raw denim subreddit that their jeans fade with a Thunderbird at certain parts of their jeans, like it's chain stitched on, hidden. So, I thought that was neat. And also, they're the first ever Native American-owned denim brand. So, I wanted to find out more about that. And then they had a $700 Legends rider jacket. So, I had to find out why is it $700.

[3:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=229s) The reason it's a rider's jacket or it's a motorcycle jacket is because Amanda's grandfather was a welder at Harley-Davidson. That was really far away. So, he had to commute all the time to keep his family in the reservation. So, Amanda and Eric made this jacket in tribute to him, which is why the sleeves are a little bit longer, which is why the back's a little bit longer.

[4:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=244s) Weirdly, we're going to talk about the outside of the jacket, not as much as the inside. The lining is the big kahuna here. I was doing one last read through on Ginew's site to see if there was anything else I missed. And then that "do you want 20% off if you sign up for emails" thing popped up and I was like, "Oh, okay. So, this jacket isn't actually $695." $695 times 0.8. Boom. $556. Outside of this jacket, 10.10 oz Texan fabric. Everything is felled. It's a very tough, beefy jacket.

[4:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=266s) Let's get to the lining because that's the coolest part. Pendleton. That's all you need to know. Pendleton. As you know, there was the pinnacle of Native American blankets, the Chief's blankets, often woven by the Navajo tribes. And then Pendleton came along and was like, "Hey, we can make blankets and fabrics and stuff like that way, way faster. Let's use your designs. Can we work with you to make blankets inspired by your designs, sometimes using your exact designs?" And bing, bang, boom, they did. They became the very famous Native American trade blankets.

[5:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=300s) Long story short, what is really cool is Pendleton is one of the most famous and one of the greatest woolen mills in the United States of America. And that is due to Native Americans, one being incredibly intense about quality and dying and everything like that to make the mill what it is. And two, because this collaboration and the designs that came from it were just so beautiful that they were loved by the world over. So, it's really cool history and it makes sense as to why Pendleton would be right here. It also makes sense as to why the jacket is so expensive. Pendleton jacquard woven fabric is not cheap.

[5:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=317s) Tom Beckbe, closest thing America has to Barbour. They're the only brand on this list that I can see realistically Barbour doing a collaboration with. They're also one of my favorite brands. I really, really, really like the Tensaw jacket. Never thought I would. Didn't think it was my style. I feel like Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner. So, I think the founder of Tom Beckbe is a lawyer. I could be wrong, but basically also an avid hunter, outdoorsman, whatever it may be. So, he wants a jacket that looks nice when he's lawyering and a jacket that looks nice when he's swinging a gun or a rifle in the air.

[5:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=347s) And that's the big thing with Tom Beckbe. You have an unbelievable amount of movement. You could put another jacket on. Actually, in fact, don't believe me? I have three wax jackets on right now. I'm like a candle. Full mobility. I could still theoretically bird hunt, throw a throwing star and go fishing and feel no restriction whatsoever.

[6:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=365s) And that was kind of the big thing I was going to get to at the end of the video with Filson and Barbour. Part of what makes Filson and Barbour rank so high and be so universally liked and everything like that is the fit. When you have enough room, you'll want to put the jacket on more. There's a reason Barbour and Filson and especially Barbour, everybody likes a Barbour. It's because you put it on and you feel no stress on fabric anywhere. So, it just feels comfortable.

[6:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=386s) Comfort is the biggest thing. I'm finding that 200 videos later, everybody wants comfort. That's all you want. Well, that's most of what you want. And you get that here on Tom Beckbe with these impossibly massive back arm gussets. And that's part of the reason why it's so important to know what a jacket is actually designed for.

[6:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=405s) Like the Ginew riders jacket, there's motorcycling in mind. Maybe it's not the perfect motorcycle jacket, but that's why you have really long sleeves and a longer body. For example, Tom Beckbe has mobility top of mind. Also, utility so you have a bunch of other little nice features and fun things like triple snap secured bellowed pocket so you can fit who knows what in there. An adjustable cuff so you can tighten things down whether you have gloves on, you don't want as much wind or rain to come through, whatever it may be.

[7:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=430s) This butt flap thing that I, you know, could be for sitting down, could be for more movement, could be for something I can't think of. A stand collar for further element protection, a two-way zip for when you're sitting down. I love two-way zip. Storm flap behind the zipper, and a storm placket to go over the zipper. And then beyond that, there's just like a billion other pockets, but there's actually two Tom Beckbe jackets in this. We're not going to go over the Shallowford as much because we don't have time, but it might be of the two my favorite. I really like kidney pockets. Any pocket that's low, I like that a lot.

[7:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=457s) Iron and Resin. I like Iron and Resin. I never reviewed any of their stuff before and I like it a lot. It's very, very motorcycle focused. So, you'll see waterproof linings in their wax jackets, which may be antithetical to any of you looking for a wax jacket to get rid of a waterproof lining, but that's, you know, if you're on a motorcycle, you probably want that. They also have the classic Enduro wax jacket, which I never thought I'd like, but I actually do love. But either way, I don't have that today. I have this and also this. That is the Scout jacket and the Cruiser jacket. Not to be confused with the Filson Cruiser jacket. Totally different things.

[8:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=489s) Iron Resin, you get a lot for what you pay for because of where it's made. Everything in Iron Resin is made overseas. So, you get a lining usually on everything. You get a waterproof liner as well. You get a nice heavyweight Halley Stevenson's fabric. This is 13 and 13.75 oz. So, it's a really nice jacket for the price that you're paying. And probably one of the best values on this list. Maybe Huckberry is up there too in terms of just price versus what you're getting.

[8:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=516s) Maybe you don't want a heavy jacket, but still you get that really good balance. This is also a good example of another jacket that has back gussets, but not nearly in the same capacity as Tom Beckbe. So, this is definitely a California cut. I've been calling things like that lately. Like when a brand is specifically from California, you can tell their pieces are supposed to be worn with a t-shirt or like a very, very, very light sweater. There's not a ton of mobility. You can't really do the hug test easily. But there's certain areas where you're never going to put anything more than a t-shirt under this.

[9:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=542s) Much like the Tom Beckbe Tensaw, I've seen the Crissman Overshirt for years and I always thought I'll never - I don't think that's for me. It just I don't think it'll fit well. It seems a little bit too long. It's not my style. It's a shirt. I want a jacket and you know it's not my thing. Totally wrong. That's why if you believe me on anything, give it a shot. If you're like on the fence, I've been on the fence about the Crissman Overshirt for years. Give it a shot because I'm pleasantly surprised.

[9:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=563s) And this is perfect. This is something that I never thought categorically. I was like, who wants an overshirt that's waxed and that has a pocket? Guess what? It turns out me. That's me. That's exactly what I want. In fact, this weather that we have right now in Portland with like gusts of 20 and it's kind of cold. I'm right on the water, so it's like a little wet. Perfect for the Crissman Overshirt in wax canvas. It's just a flannel with teeth is what it feels like. And I really love it. I really love the reinforcements on the arm. It's a nice beautiful shirt that you never wash and it just gets better and better with time.

[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=600s) Yeah. Okay, now we're officially in the voting section. All of these pieces, by the way, in the video have been voted on, but they just didn't rank officially. Now, all these other ones do. These are the internet's favorites.

[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=617s) Bradley Mountain. So, this is the Wilder 10-year anniversary backpack from Bradley Mountain. I have a bunch of cool stuff in it I want to show you that I'll show you in a future video, but I don't have actually Bradley Mountain's wax jacket that I had last video. I gave that to a friend. If you like this big, meaty, heavy wax canvas bag with a ton of leather on it. Everything is way overbuilt. We got leather washers on these giant smashed rivets. It just looks like it was built by some jacked dude in a cabin.

[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=644s) If you like that, then there's no doubt in my mind that you would love everything Bradley Mountain makes. But also, I think you'd really like their Cabin Wax Jacket, which I have had in the past. Now, a friend of mine has it. But either way, it's beautiful. It's a little shorter in the sleeves than you might expect. So, if you're a long person, you might need to size up. But the back measurement is really wide, so you can move all day in that thing. It's for the guy that has an enamel coffee cup and likes to go into a log cabin and have an axe.

[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=671s) Okay, now we're officially in the big dog territory. 27% of the votes. Now with these brands, we're playing a competition of how many A-list celebrity male actors have worn your jacket. The Rogue Territory Supply Jacket, we have Daniel Craig, Ryan Reynolds, the guy from Split, the guy from Better Call Saul, and like a billion other people. And there's good reason for that really. This jacket looks great on muscular A-list celebrity actors because it's plain, it's simple, it lets your muscles do the talking and it's nice and slim.

[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=700s) So, if you're Ryan Reynolds with a cup of coffee walking, you look great. And that's actually my favorite thing about the Rogue Territory Supply Jacket. It's so simple. There's no lining. There's nothing to it. It's just a simple Supply Jacket. Well, you have this little detail. This is a shout to if you had a pocket watch, you would put the little chain through there. Now people put their sunglasses on it and stuff like that. But that's the beauty of the Rogue Territory Supply Jacket.

[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=720s) Recently, I've been starting to really like minimal pieces. Just how much stuff can you take away and just keep the bare essentials? You can do clever stuff with what you have, but you don't have to over complicate anything. One thing that I didn't mention - well, I did mention that it's not lined, but usually I kind of always want a liner, especially with wax jackets because it's waxy, so it gets on your skin. It's kind of gross. But in my old age, as I've fallen old over the years, I kind of see why you wouldn't line something. Sometimes if you go the satin sleeve route, you really limit how often you can wear the jacket because the second it's a little too warm, the sleeves start to stick to your skin and feel a little bit gross.

[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=738s) Freenote Cloth Riders Jacket. 38 votes. Worn by Conan O'Brien, Teddy Baldassare of YouTube watch fame, the guys on Yellowstone, bunch of other famous people. I'm going to say something crazy. And no, this video is not sponsored by Freenote Cloth. It's actually sponsored by Huckberry, who we'll talk about in a second. But in my opinion, Freenote Cloth is one of the greatest, if not the greatest American heritage brands ever. At least in modern times, one of the greatest ever. Their stuff is truly some of the greatest clothing in this niche that I've ever seen. They have gussets that are elasticated in the back which is a total Wrangler homage. This is a piece where this becomes your jacket. People establish it as like say your name is Tim. Like that's Tim's jacket. Tim wears that jacket every single day. And if Tim ever lost that jacket, he has to get a new one immediately.

[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=790s) Oh crap. I left the Filson Cruiser at home. That was going to be the big thing that I had to talk about because it's an old one and they left the tags on the inside. So it talks about the fabric weight and stuff. Very interesting. They're going to splice this in.

[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=808s) Disclaimer before this segment starts. It is impossible for me to know why a company made a change from this to this. It could be for drape. It could be for style. It could be for comfort. It could be for some other reason. It could just be a better version. I want to start off by saying this is my wax jacket. I have a lot of wax jackets now and you know, some come in and some come out. But this Filson and the Barbour are the ones that consistently stay at my house. They can sleep over. They ask their parents and it's okay.

[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=835s) For me, this jacket is short enough. The sleeves are perfect length. They're a little shorter because I have a big sweater on under this, but the jacket's cut really well for me. It feels good. It's nice and simple. Nothing's too complex. I like simplicity lately. I think that's really cool. So, I like this jacket a lot. That being said, this one's been bought and sold a lot. They used to say, "We're never leaving the USA manufacturing. That is in our blood. That's this and that." That wasn't true. Now, this jacket is made in Bangladesh. It's still stunning quality. There's not a misstitch on it. It's fantastic. But, it does go for $350.

[14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=865s) And if you look at all the other brands that we're talking about today, mostly made in the US. It seems a little lopsided with price. You'd think it'd be a little bit lower because they moved overseas for cheaper manufacturing, but it's not. But sometimes it is. Top row $210. Next row $350. But you can sign up for an email and get 10% off. And you might even be able to get 10% off the $210. In which case, then all of a sudden it's like, whoa, this is a great deal.

[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=890s) Filson has the benefit of being an old company. So stuff that stays in their catalog for a long time, like the Short Lined Tin Cloth line, that's tried, true, tested, and a design that just works and people love. So, their designs tend to be fantastic. Would I recommend this jacket? Yes, totally. Has there been changes at Filson? Yes, totally. This is a 14oz fabric and this is a 14oz fabric, but they are not the same. This is dramatically heavier than this fabric.

[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=915s) Sorry, bad demo. This is not the 14 oz fabric. This is a 12.5 oz fabric, but it's heavier than the 14 oz fabric. You can measure fabric by the linear yard or by the square yard. And the square yard is heavier than the linear yard at the same yard length. This 12.5 oz fabric nowadays would probably be called 18 to 20 oz fabric in my estimation, depending on actual width of the fabric they're using now.

[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=945s) So, it is much heavier than that fabric. See how the arms if I fold them up like that, they kind of stay. If I scrunch up the body, it stays up. This is soft and drapey. This is stiff and it's like a cardboard box. I like that you can always get an old vintage Filson and get the heavier weight. But I just like to see all the clever stuff that Filson did, like what I talked about in the intro with the sleeve here, but also this I think is genius. This is two layers of wax canvas. So this jacket's actually a monster. But you can see they open it up so when you bend your arm it flexes easier. And if we really want to nerd out, check out these Mackinaw Cruisers from the 1930s I was looking at on eBay with the offset pockets.

[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=969s) Hope you like the Filson section. Now we're on to Flint and Tinder. This video is sponsored by Huckberry, but the good news is I've talked about the Flint and Tinder Wax Trucker many, many times before I was sponsored by Huckberry. So, you know, I'm not lying to you to get those big fat Huckberry bucks. Huckberry asked me to say two things. One, this is the jacket Pedro Pascal wears in The Last of Us, which I have not seen season 2 yet. I heard there's a big twist. Don't tell me about it. And two, One-Stop Men's Shop. Huckberry is the one-stop men's shop. If you're looking to one-stop at a men's shop, you go to Huckberry.

[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1005s) Pedro Pascal. Pedro Pascal. What jacket is Pedro Pascal wearing in The Last of Us? Sorry, I just had to do that to get those sweet, sweet search term views. If you ask me who is the Flint and Tinder Wax Trucker Jacket for, the answer is everyone. It is literally built for everyone. That is why it is Huckberry's number one selling product because it's built that way. It's a little bit longer than the other jackets we talked about. The sleeves are a little bit longer. I rolled them up because of that.

[17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1030s) It goes with anything. It's not crazy lightweight, but it is a lighter weight, so it's comfortable. It's cut well, so you have full freedom of movement. It's lined, so that way it's comfortable. You don't get wax on your skin. They also make a really nice wool lined one that I'm yet to get, but it's a heavier one all around. So, I have to try that one out. I also feel like, you know what, Huckberry, now that I have you on the line, I would like it if you made a shorter one, too. I think that'd be really cool.

[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1055s) The real magic is the price. $300 for this jacket is, you know, for a lined jacket, made in the US, wax jacket from Martexen Fabric. That's why this jacket is so hard to not recommend to people. You're not really making some obvious sacrifice on this jacket. It's not like this is a coated polyester instead of a wax cotton canvas. It's not like it's even from a different mill. Thanks for the sponsor, Huckberry. Easy to sponsor a video when you want me to shout out a product I talk about. Anyway, also you guys put it to the top. Yeah, 96 votes.

[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1066s) And finally, smashing every single other brand on this list with 186 votes. Just destroyed the competition. Of course, it's Barbour. Uh-oh, it's raining. So, you know, I had to put the Barbour on and come back out and redo the shot because I think this is simply - I think this is why Barbour just crushed the competition. When you think wax jackets, you're probably thinking rain coverage and everything else that we talked about today. For the most part, it's not a designated rain jacket, which in my head means the fabric is lightweight.

[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1100s) This is the lightest weight fabric we're talking about today. This is 6 oz Sylkoil, Barbour's proprietary fabric. It's long. You could toss on anything under it. I'm wearing the Billy Goat under this, which is the Iron Snail incredibly heavy woolen sweater that we're probably going to release in June. But either way, that flexibility means if it's the fall time, if it's the summertime, if it's the springtime, any time of year, you could toss on your Barbour and be super comfortable.

[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1130s) We have a throat latch, which I love and I'm employing right now. Snaps for a hood, which I have. I just can't find it. I had a hood, by the way. I bought one just to show you for this video. I bought a used one. I think someone hemmed the sleeves a lot or was a woman, so I gave it to Taylor's sister Cassidy. I'll get a new one a different day. But you get a hood. You have storm cuffs which is really helpful in inclement weather. Big bellows snap pockets. Nothing too crazy although we have vents at the bottom which I think is pretty cool. And we have vents under the underarm which is also pretty cool.

[19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1160s) And then something that I was really obsessed with for a while is that you could buy a bunch of different liners for your Barbour. So if it's cold you can add one in. If it's not, take it off, add the hood on. Add a different type of hood on. There's just so much lore around this waxed green cloth. Okay. I'll see you all very soon.

[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3giKIuJjDk&t=1185s) Hey, thanks for commenting that the videos have reached a peak of going too fast and they're too hard to understand textually and visually and all that. There's a big comment on it. I appreciate that. It's very easy, at least for me, to get in my head and think all these things that aren't true and all that and then the videos become mega two times speed cruisers. So, trying to slow this down. I'll try again next week when we talk about Clarks.
