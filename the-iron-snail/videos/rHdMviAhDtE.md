# The Internet's Favorite Down Jackets, Ranked.

## Summary

Michael from The Iron Snail surveyed his audience to determine their favorite down jacket brands, then purchased 15 jackets from the top-recommended brands to compare them definitively. The video proceeds from lowest to highest cost, examining each jacket's fill power, construction method, and unique features while identifying who each jacket is best suited for.

The review covers everything from budget options like Uniqlo's Seamless Down Parka (with its concerning resin coating that eventually decays) to premium heritage brands like Canada Goose ($1,400) and artisan makers like Feathered Friends. Michael explains technical concepts like fill power (how efficient the down is at taking up space), construction methods (stitch-through vs. seamless vs. box baffle), and why the Decathlon MT900 at $250 offers incredible value with features typically found on jackets costing twice as much.

The video highlights that the "best" jacket depends entirely on matching your needs to the designer's intentions - whether you need an ultralight mountaineering layer, a lifestyle piece for city walks, or a heritage-style tank that will last decades.

## Highlights

### "This jacket is coated in resin that will start peeling"

## Key Points

- **Fill Power Explained** ([2:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=143s)) - Higher fill power (like 1000) means less down takes up more space, making jackets lighter; lower fill power (500) requires more down, making jackets heavier

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=0s) This is one of the most legendary jackets to ever come out of Japan. The Mont Bell Plasma 1000. This is the Canada Goose Windom Parker. It costs $1400. Wow, that's so cheap. Function is Beauty or Kinoi in Japanese, is the concept of finding beauty and expert craftsmanship. Mountain Hardware, founded in 1993 on Halloween. They have mythical, scary, spooky jackets like the Ghost Whisperer. They also made my favorite down jacket of all time.

[0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=30s) The North Face and Patagonia, two of the biggest outdoor down jacket titans to ever grace this planet. How do they compare? And Unilo, the only jacket that I would not totally say is a good Welcome to the internet's favorite down jackets ranked, if that's the title of this video. Still, I asked you, henceforth known as the internet, what your favorite down jacket brand was and why. And then I tallied up all the results and made a top 10 list of your recommendations.

[0:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=59s) Then I whipped out my Chase Inc. business card and bought every single jacket in the top 10 list plus a few more that I thought were cool. I think we have technically we have 15. Anyways, I bought all of them so we could figure out definitively who makes the best bang for your buck. Is it Unilo or is it Canada Goose or is it somewhere in between? It's somewhere in between, I think, personally.

[1:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=78s) What's up, guys? It's Michael. Hope everybody's doing well. Did this I did the intro. This happens every time. I was cracking up. I was like, that was a great, very fun intro. Memory card crashed. Too cold. I think I have no idea why, but shame. None of us get to see that funny intro. You just get that sucky one.

[1:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=93s) This video will proceed as follows. We will go from the lowest cost down jacket to the absolute highest. Each brand or jacket will get a rundown boiling each piece down to what you need to know about it and what is great about it. And finally, the most important part, we have a black screen, white line that says who each jacket is built for because these are all almost great jackets, but you and the person designing the jacket need to match up and have the same goals or else even if it's a really nice jacket, you won't like it.

[2:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=120s) These first three down jackets actually probably the weirdest combination on this list because I'd really recommend two of them and I would not recommend one of them and that would be this one, the Unilo Seamless Down Parka. And I shouldn't say I wouldn't recommend Unilo, but there is stuff that you need to know about it before you buy it that for me I'm not a huge fan of. But today it is a very nice parka. That's the problem. So come here, let me tell you.

[2:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=143s) Fill power. Think of fill power as how efficient is the down? How much space will it take up in a certain size container? So if it's a really high fill power like a 1000, not a lot of down is going to take up a lot of space. So the jacket can be really light and efficient and fluffy. But if it's a lower fill power like 500, you need a lot more down to take up the same amount of space. So it makes the jacket very heavy. 1,000 fill power down also very expensive. 500 cheaper.

[2:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=169s) Another really important thing is how is the down jacket constructed? The most basic form of construction stitch through construction. Talk about this on every single down jacket video. That is just stitching through the down. So you would see a stitch line right here. This is a seamless down jacket. So, instead of stitching, we're using adhesives or it depends on the brand, but we're seaming everything together without stitches.

[3:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=190s) Hey, hey, let's cut this bad boy open and see what the heck's inside of it. I really hate the idea of cutting open a perfectly good garment. We're going to go right for the heart. We have this downproof fabric. The down is inside of that. And we stitch it to this layer right here. So, we have this white fabric with these little strips making the baffles. The outside of the fabric doesn't have any stitch lines because it's on this and then it's heat bonded right there. And on this jacket, we use 750 fill power down.

[3:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=220s) So on its face and today it's great. I really like those stats and I like the look of this jacket. But if we go inside of the jacket, you will see a really long detailed and thorough care label. If we go to the bottom, it says, "Hey, by the way, this entire jacket is coated in a resin that whether you wear it or not or store it properly or not is going to start peeling, flaking, and falling off." That's just how the jacket's going to be. The second it's made, it will start to decay.

[4:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=243s) Okay. So, after all that, I don't want to say that I don't recommend it, but I would say the seams that hold all the down together could fail. It is 750 fill power down. It is a cool technology. It is stylish, and it's not super expensive. And the timeline of when it will fail is really determined on how you wear it, where you live, everything like that. So, it may last you 3 years, it may last you 10 years. I don't know. Nobody knows. It's all a bunch of different variables.

[4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=270s) I always like to say if you're trying to spend as little as possible on a down jacket, you got to go on eBay first cuz there's the craziest things on the planet. But if you don't want to do that and you think 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, whatever, out of this jacket is fine, then maybe Uniqlo is for you.

[4:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=298s) Oops, Edward, I found a spelling mistake on your website. You said this jacket is sadroof. I think you meant waterproof. $175 for this down jacket is kind of an insane deal. This is the superior down parker from Eddie Bower. 650 fill power down, waterproof, seam sealed. Most people, you give them a jacket that's triple the price. Probably wouldn't notice that much of a difference.

[5:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=314s) This is just stitch through baffle construction. That was on the first down jacket that you could still wear today, 100 years later. Nothing new, nothing crazy, and they're very solid. I got my dad a First Ascent Eddie Bower down jacket probably 15 years ago. He still wears it basically every single day in the winter. Looks great. First Ascent is Eddie Bower's higher line. That stuff looks pretty good to me.

[5:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=334s) I never heard Decathlon in my life. And I was like, it's probably not going to be that good. It's probably just going to be a regular whatever jacket. Nope. That's one of the best jackets that I've ever seen for this price. $250 for look at this.

[5:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=349s) Hey, you. Do you pay rent? Good. Let's make it worth your while. This video is sponsored by Built. Built gives you loyalty points if you pay your rent through them. You can use those points on airlines, on hotels, on fitness classes, and dining.

[6:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=398s) $250 for look at this zippered chest pockets which are a must for me on any down jacket. An internal downsted storm placket to keep you warm under the seam of the zipper. An internal storm cuff that also has a full cuff that wraps around it that's reinforced so when you're climbing or doing something crazy, this doesn't rip. Hand pockets that are cut behind the down, which is one of my favorite things. So that way you don't need to bring mittens cuz your hands are warm from this.

[7:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=423s) But at the same time, see how the zipper when I zip it isn't exposed. And there's this little lip. That's so if you put your hands in your pocket, you have a little shield from snow, rain, or whatever else can come in. 800 fill power down. It is a 85/15 duck blend, so I did save some money there. But who's complaining? And at the same time, they use box baffled construction throughout the entire jacket. That's for 250 smackers. Are you kidding me? What the heck is going on?

[7:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=447s) Oh, did I said box baffle construction? If this is a chamber of down and we're going to sew it into two different baffles, you can just do sewn through construction like this down here, down here, cold spot in the middle with air going through and no down. Or you can add a strip of fabric here and have box baffled construction. It's a slower, more expensive process to do, but your down is sitting on a table instead of being squished together into one piece. For that price, that is absolutely insane. Most of these jackets are far more expensive. They don't have all the features that the Decathlon has. So, I ranked that very high.

[8:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=481s) I don't think I'm a big fat sucker, but sometimes I am a big fat sucker and I like it because while Decathlon is 250 and you get every single speck under the sun and it's a fantastic jacket, this North Face is also $250 and it doesn't have any of that. Doesn't have a single thing like that. Not even my favorite thing on a down jacket, which is the chest pocket. But I like Northface. And I'm not afraid to say, actually, I'm a little afraid to say it. People would be mean to me about that.

[8:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=508s) But every single outdoor brand on the face of the planet has to decide. They're using all the cool materials and cool tech. So naturally, the fashion crowd does get to them and they want them. So every brand has to be like, are we going to stick with our roots? Are we a mountaineering brand or are we going to be a fashion brand or are we going to try and do both?

[8:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=524s) Northace is interesting because part of their history is becoming one of the first ever outdoor fashion brands in New York and they're tied in with hip-hop culture and everything like that. So, there is some Northace brand tax going on because this and the Decathlon are the same price and Northace couldn't even be asked to put a pocket on the inside. You just have the two hand warmer pockets. There's no flap for snow or anything like that.

[9:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=547s) Barebones basic 600 fill stitch through construction. This is a pretty regular YKK Vizlon zipper, very plain but incredibly smooth and satisfying to zip. The hand pockets are cut into the side baffles so you don't need mittens and I like that it does not have any really bell or whistle. It's just a down jacket and it's good for what it is. A lifestyle jacket. I feel totally comfortable wearing it in these woods. Dead simple. Not a lot of stuff to break, repair, or go wrong.

[9:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=570s) I don't I'm just trying to say it's not the best value for your money, but I really like it. There's something about dead simplicity and not including anything that you might not need in New York City when you're going for a walk that is cool. Oh, and really important, Northace also has their Summit series. That on the other hand is Northace's serious mountaineering brand. That stuff is insane. Look at how they're mapping down channels and stuff like that for active insulation. So, if you really want to geek out on performance with Northace, you can. But at the same time, if you want a lifestyle jacket, you have that, too. And you do pay the Northace tax.

[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=610s) Patagonia is so great essentially because it checks the box I feel like for absolutely everybody. It is more expensive than the North Face and this is 600 fill down and it is pretty bare bones but it does have an internal pocket which is nice. It is totally function first. It's made in a fair trade facility. Everything is recycled, decycled, upcycled, downcycled. And Patagonia has their infinite lifetime billion-year warranty where if you ring the jacket in, they'll fix it or they'll just get you a new one and say ride partner.

[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=640s) Whatever you're looking for in a brand or in a jacket is with Patagonia except this hood. This is an old school hood out of all. This is a heritage style jacket. This is a really not smooth at all. It's a I think it's a four ply nylon which is the most insane thing to put here in a cool way. But the downdrift jacket is essentially an homage to the big tank jackets from Northace and Patagonia in the 80s, I want to say, maybe early 90s, where they're just indestructible. They're not meant to be ultra light. They're just for everyday use, lifestyle, heritage.

[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=669s) Mountain Hardware, their Subzero jacket that I talked about last year, that's my down jacket. I wear that everywhere we go. I love every single thing about it. It's fantastic. It's very warm. I would kiss it if I could. Well, I could, but I'm I guess it's not right now. The Ghost Whisperer is kind of the flagship ultra light down jacket that you can whip on. You don't feel it at all. You can put a hard shell over it. It's tight to your body purposely. It's meant for climbing and everything like that, but I don't think 99% of people need it that light.

[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=699s) And with that, you can get a lot more durability for the same price. This is 10 denure nylon, so it's very, very light, soft, silky smooth and everything. But no matter how hard you try, you will put a hole in it by accident. If it gets stuck on a car door or a branch or something as you walk by, you'll poke through it. The North Face that we're talking about is 30 denure and feels like glass. If that's what you're after, that's what I would recommend because you'll be that person that sooner or later has their jacket filled with tenacious tape patches and everything like that. And most of us can spare a few extra grams or even ounces on a jacket that will last longer and look better. But this is cool for those that need it.

[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=738s) Oh yeah. Rab is good. Oh, their tag. They are firmly a mountaineering company. Their tagline is the mountain people and they haven't veered from that at all. So, I don't need a lot of these features. Probably neither do you, but they are cool to talk about. For example, look at the hood. You could fold it up into some type of stand collar. I imagine that is only helpful if you're blaying someone. You need to get the hood out of the way. Love that.

[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=760s) Also, the hand pockets start higher up, so that way you have belay equipment around your waist and still have full access to both of these pockets. Also, 20 denure nylon 800 fill down. And this is stuffed pretty heavily, so it's mega warm. We also get into the territory of down baffle mapping, which Outdoor Research does it too. I think Mountain Hardware does it too. I'm just showing it off specifically on RAB. Places where there's a really high chance of the down shifting like not maybe these baffles you're not moving as much but across the shoulders or something or if you need more warmth they change the baffle design.

[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=793s) Montbell plasma 1000 jacket. If you thought 10 denure nylon was thin, this is seven. Same thing I said with the ghost whisperer, but even more. This is even more delicate. Every review I read of it, everyone saying they were very careful as they traverse through the woods. It's cool. It's brilliant. It's shockingly warm because it uses where is it? 1,000 fill power down. And for what you're getting, it's not that it is expensive. It's $400 something dollars. But for what Montbell is doing, you're getting a very, very good deal.

[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=827s) They make uh I forget what it's called. I'd probably get something with a stronger shell. They have a 30 denure version of the jacket that I actually think is very cool. Mont Bell uses skip stitches. So, we have the baffles here, but then we have these skip stitches that further help to lock down in place. And they don't go all the way through to reduce cold spots where air goes through, but they do kind of trap it and make a maze.

[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=851s) Fjallraven is a very interesting company. They have a very, very strong cult following and a big thesis of theirs is all these brands say this is the newest technology to keep you dry or keep you this, keep you that. Were using these chemicals and stuff and then 10 years later they say like, "Oops, sorry. Those chemicals turned out to be very bad for everybody involved. Why not just skip them entirely and stick to the old classics?"

[14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=875s) So, this is actually a polyester cotton blend. And I don't know if you can tell, but I waxed it. You can definitely tell on this sleeve because I 100% overwaxed it. So, thin layers, not one big heavy layer like I did. That's the point of Fjallraven's G1000 fabric. Wax it, wash it, do whatever you want and increase the water resistance. But with Fjallraven, that does not make it waterproof that's water resistant. You have to want that. You have to be ready for it cuz you can't expect this to act like Gore-Tex or any other really new technology. Still works really well, but it's not the same and it requires a lot more care and a lot more upkeep. Probably the only jacket I'm totally comfortable doing this with.

[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=916s) This, my feathered friends, is a little brand they like to call feathered friends. The people actually making the jackets and down comforters and everything for feathered friends are some of the most skilled down jacket whatever makers on the entire planet. That is not an overexaggeration. This is top of the top of the top of the line, but it is also a little old school at the same time.

[15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=938s) This is the Volant jacket. I didn't even bring the hood with me. It's the same as a Patagonia one. Can't stand those hoods. But what's really important about them is the craftsmanship. It's absolutely stuffed to the gills with 900 filled down. It is packed to the absolute brim. It has these cool pockets with down on the front and behind you. So, there's no cold spots whatsoever.

[15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=958s) But also, this is a tuck stitch. So, the fabric is tucked in and sewn. So, if I pull the jacket apart, you could see obviously that it's stitched together. But those stitches are hidden inside of the jacket, adding wind protection, adding durability, everything like that. So cool. So hard to do. Takes longer to do. And the Feathered Friends jackets. They're expensive, but not as expensive as I would think with what you're getting.

[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=985s) I picked up a little heritage run. We're not going to go through every jacket in a ton of detail. Three of them, though. Oh, that not that one. Thank you to the man on eBay that sold me this jacket cuz I asked him if he could expedite the package and he did in time for this video. That was very light, so I didn't need him to do that anyways, but it was very nice.

[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=997s) Rocky Mountain freaking feather bed. What makes Rocky Mountain feather bed stand out from like an 80s Northace is this leather combination tanned seamless yolk for a backpack for added durability for style. Obviously Schaefer's big thing was this yolk. So you see it throughout all of their clothing, all of their gear. But this is just a classic jacket. Ooh, I did that. I got a puff of the old users cologne. You smell very nice.

[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=1022s) I snagged the Filson waxed down jacket. I've had the down cruiser before. I really like the down cruiser. The down jacket is great, but the liner is it's almost like there's too much liner in the jacket. So, this is the first time in Filson history I've ever had to size up one.

[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=1037s) But the other jacket that I got was the best rendition of a Karakoram I've ever seen by a company called All Blues Co. Every single mountaineering jacket that we talked about that you see, their great great grandfather is the Karakoram. Developed by Eddie Bauer in lock step with the most daring people on the planet. Nylon cotton on the outside, cinches everywhere. These beautiful matte red buttons. You could probably size down and still fit in it, but why? When you get that jacket, just don't even put pants on. Totally Donald Duck it. Welcome to the show, everybody. This is a Karakoram.

[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=1077s) I need Canada Goose. They're here. Another box in the box. Canada Goose Arctic Program. There's a bag in the boxes box. Canada Goose.

[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=1089s) Oh, it has the backpack straps. I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable bringing this jacket outside because I am sadly going to return this jacket. Not because I don't like it, just because it is $1,400. But 625 fill power down, 83% polyester, 17% organic cotton, arctite tech fabric, a reinforced nylon cuff, extra long and tight storm cuffs, double stack sewn on the baffle, pockets.

[18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=1112s) Siri defined cantankerous, bad-tempered, argumentative, and uncooperative. Not a cantankerous hood. A very large hood though. And that's really it. I think all of the design and everything on Canada Goose is brilliant. I think this is a really cool looking jacket. They are made in Canada.

[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=1129s) But shout out to Oddvik, Quartz Co., Outdoor Survival Canada and I put Crescent Down Works in there because we didn't talk about them this video, but they're in the US. They're a whole bunch of things and they make really high quality jackets, but their jackets are still just down jackets. They're not any warmer unless you get a giant one. They're not any more water resistant. They're just incredibly overbuilt tanks because their history was a lot of their stuff was for Arctic researchers who didn't own their coats, so they would pass them to someone else. So, they needed to last for a really long time. And that DNA works really well for a very high quality jacket brand that pivoted to luxury because it looks cool and it ages even better with that cotton blend.

[19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdMviAhDtE&t=1164s) Okie dokie though. That is very much it. Thank you for watching.
