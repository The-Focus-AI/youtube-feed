# The 125-Year-Old Wool Jacket Brands Still Can't Beat.

## Summary

Michael explores the fascinating history and innovative technology behind Brown's Beach Cloth, a revolutionary fabric introduced by William W. Brown in 1901. What made this Connecticut-developed material so special was that it used "shoddy" (recycled wool fibers), which had a terrible reputation after Civil War uniform scandals, but Brown ingeniously used it in a way that actually improved the garment rather than cheapening it.

The video breaks down the technical brilliance of Brown's Beach Cloth: it's a warp knit (not woven, not standard weft knit) that combines cotton on the outside for durability and recycled wool fleece on the inside for warmth. This construction created a jacket that was one-third the weight of traditional woven wool coats while being just as warm, plus more breathable, wind-resistant, water-resistant, and elastic. The vest was particularly revolutionary as it allowed workers to upgrade their existing kits with new fabric technology without replacing their entire wardrobe.

Michael argues that Brown's Beach Cloth was essentially ahead of its time, predicting that knit fabrics would eventually dominate even workwear. The brand was ultimately killed by synthetic fibers in the 1960s, but modern Japanese manufacturers like Fullcount (who now own the brand), Anatomica, and Kapital have revived these garments. Michael also teases that he's sampling Brown's Beach Cloth for a secret Iron Snail clothing project.

## Transcript

[0:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=7s) Hey, why did Milkman and Delivery Boys wear this specific vest? Initially, everything made in this fabric, like this vest or that jacket, those were designed specifically for outdoor sportsmen or lumberjacks or something like that in the cold. However, this fabric, the formula of the jackets and the vest were so special that all of a sudden everybody was dying to get anything they could in this fabric.

[0:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=31s) So, your local lumberjack, hunters, fishermen, all wearing it. Your delivery boys were wearing it, but also people in Antarctica were wearing it on first ever US expeditions and crazy things mainly because of this fabric. Like I said, what's up everybody? It's Michael. Don't worry, we are going to the woods. Taylor just asked me if I could get cream for her from the grocery store and I said, "Yeah, of course. Maybe I could maybe you could watch me throw it in the air for about 20 minutes for a video."

[0:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=55s) Today's video will cover Brown's beachcloth garments introduced by William W. Brown in 1901. William Brown's fabric in the 1900s was basically considered like a space age fabric. It was mind-blowing. People were writing him letters begging him to never change the configuration of it because it was perfect. But what's interesting at the same time is he kind of had to hide the secret of his fabric.

[1:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=80s) Mr. Brown's shoddy trash fabric, though, had one major trick up its sleeve. It was virtually unbeatable in situations like this. More comfortable, warmer, more breathable, wind-resistant, water resistant, and really elastic. That's what he kept saying, elastic. Browns Beach Cloth fabric developed in Connecticut and then later made in Worcester, Massachusetts, very close to where I'm from. Very proud of that fact.

[1:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=108s) We're breaking this video up into three distinct sections. Number one, why do I keep calling Brown's beach cloth shoddy trash? Point number two, this is a very weird fabric. And most of the time people get it, including me before I did this video, people get it wrong when they're talking about what this is. And finally, number three, besides the fabric being really cool and it being shoddy trash, there are a bunch of other features that made the jacket so... well the vest specifically so famous for the time.

[2:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=137s) Why did people in the 1920s and 1960s up until then like them so much? And then you know what came in the 1960s and destroyed everything. But either way, that's the blueprint for today's video. Let's go. Oh, also at the end of this trail, it's not that far in the woods, but there's a waterfall. Going to see what happens when it's 10 degrees outside. I haven't seen it yet in the winter. So, we could test the water resistance of this jacket there, too. Theoretically, I'm wearing all wool.

[2:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=166s) William Brown in Brown's Beachcloth had a secret. It wasn't really a secret, but he didn't want to advertise it at all because it was hated in America. Had a terrible reputation, and that was shoddy. The thing is, William Brown used shoddy in basically the only way where it didn't make a garment worse. But you're probably thinking, "What the heck is shoddy?"

[3:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=190s) Shoddy was just what they called recycled fabric way back when in the 1800s. First started off in England, and that's where it got the name shoddy. And the process of making recycled clothing really hasn't changed since the 1800s. It's the same thing. You're taking a woolen cloth, usually a rag in this case. You're grinding it up into shorter fibers, you're making it into a yarn, and then you reweave that yarn.

[3:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=210s) So, for a while, Shoddy kind of has the same reputation that polyester has now, where people are like, "No, I want 100% cotton or 100% wool. You're just putting polyester in to make it cheaper." Some people didn't like that. Some people didn't care. Other people understood why they were doing that.

[3:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=223s) But then the Civil War happened and the Civil War had a lot of people enlisting very, very, very fast. And the US government was like, "Hey, clothing brands, we need uniforms very fast." So, they basically made junk uniforms that didn't fit. They didn't have button holes or they were missing buttons. They fell apart in the rain cuz they were glued together scraps of fabric. Absolute junk. And what did soldiers call that? Shoddy.

[4:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=247s) So all of a sudden a lot of laws get passed. The machines that make shoddy in England are nicknamed and were always nicknamed devils. And what they made was called devil's dust. Shoddy was not doing so well. And then finally that leads to our man William Brown whose fabric was just getting extremely popular. So he was kind of not trying to advertise that it was a repurposed wool, but also repurposed wool at that time had a certain set of standards that made it a little higher quality.

[4:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=278s) [Sponsor segment - Runna running app]

[5:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=340s) Beachcloth is actually one of the most nerdy fabrics that you could possibly have because it's a multifibered fabric. We're using cotton and wool, not just wool. And it's a knit. It is not a woven, but it's a specific type of knit, not like what you see on a t-shirt or a sweatshirt. More so like what you see on a bag of oranges at the grocery store or a soccer net.

[5:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=359s) There's two main ways of making fabric. There is weaving and there is knitting. When we're thinking of woven goods, think of like my pants, denim jeans, canvas, Oxford cloth, button-downs, and stuff like that. It's a firm fabric that doesn't stretch, holds structure, really good against abrasion, tough work wear. That's a grid. So, we have warp yarns and then we have weft yarns that pass through.

[6:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=379s) Then we have knitting, which is all fundamentally loops. That's it. Weft knitting is what we're most used to on t-shirts and sweatshirts. The ribbing of this mitten is very stretchy because you have a bunch of loops that can stretch out when you pull on them. It's very comfortable. Often times, not as dense as a woven fabric to get the same thickness. So, it's airy, a little warmer for weight ratio, but it doesn't hold its shape over a long period of time. It could bag and sag out. And if you snag it, it could run and kind of unravel.

[6:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=406s) So Brown's Beach Cloth uses a form of knitting called warp knitting. Weft knitting is a bunch of loops, one main yarn, and it interlocks those loops one at a time. Warp knitting, on the other hand, is a bunch of yarns and a bunch of loops happening at the same time. And it has kind of a blend between knitting and weaving. It is just knitting, but it has good qualities of both.

[7:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=425s) The first thing that it doesn't do is unravel or ladder if there's a hole in it. So if you think of a soccer net, if you kicked a ball in it and there was a hole in that net, it doesn't go poof and just open up. It's also more structurally stable. So if you have bullets or heavy tools or something down here, it's not going to stretch out and bag out and lose shape and kind of sag down all day.

[7:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=441s) But at the same time, it is still a knit and it is still based on loops. So you have a lot more flexibility, a lot more comfort, and the loft is higher because you can lay in a fleece, which is what's happening here. Which means, which is the coolest part, it's just about as warm as a big woven wool jacket.

[7:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=456s) I just spent about 20 minutes standing right there stationary eating my filming snack. Felt pretty comfortable. Little cold. Hands are cold, but I broke my microphone again. Yesterday, I got a little too excited and tried to talk about the buttons and I ripped the microphone from the cord. All of a sudden, a brand gets caught here and then I just kept going. Absolutely no idea. I was talking to no one for about 45 minutes, doing my thing. And today I ripped the clip that goes on here off. So, we have to pinch it like this. So, my hands are cold.

[8:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=486s) So, if you were in the 1920s, you'd already be impressed that it gets close to a woven wool coat. But it's also about one-third of the weight because of this lofted fleece. But the ingenuity of Brown's Beachcloth doesn't end there. It's all about the fibers and the specific wool cotton blend they're using that makes it so brilliant and makes it functional.

[8:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=510s) Oh, well, that's the waterfall. I don't know why I was expecting to see like Niagara Falls or something here. I've seen it a few months ago. It's pretty not spectacular then either. Hopefully you weren't like, "Well, I don't really care about Brown's Beach Cloth, but I'd love to see that waterfall." He really sold me on it. Whatever. Use AI. Make AI waterfall. Look at that.

[8:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=531s) So, we can break Brown's beach cloth into two distinct areas. The front or the outside, and then the back or the inside, the fluffy and the not fluffy. The outside zigzag salt and pepper part of the fabric is two ply yarn cotton. So, two yarns spun around each other and then knit into loops and everything like that.

[9:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=547s) That is very useful. And cotton is and always probably has been cheaper than wool. So, that reduces the cost right away. But also, wool is strong, but it's very elastic and not as strong as cotton, especially when it's wet. So, a really big woven woolen jacket is fine, but when you're playing with a knit, you probably want some more abrasion resistance, strength, and stuff like that, which we talked about in the Merino t-shirt video.

[9:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=568s) So, there's you could see how much stronger cotton is. You could also see in that graph that it's not as stretchy as wool, which is important when you want your knit piece to hold its shape a little bit better.

[9:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=576s) But on the inside, that's where it gets even more brilliant. And we get the recycling devil machine things from the early 1800s in full bore. This, my friends, is our shoddy trash hated during the Civil War part of the fabric. This is recycled wool. Or theoretically, it was. I don't know if the modern versions are.

[9:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=596s) Recycled, mechanically ground up fabrics are weaker because we're taking a wool fiber or a cotton fiber that's originally say this long and then we're making it that long. But fleece is a bursted yarn. So you basically get a machine, you rip up all of the loops and everything that go into making a fleece and then you screw it all up and destroy the fibers so they're fluffy and lofted.

[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=615s) Those long fiber lengths don't matter because you're going to destroy the yarns anyways as part of the use of the garment. So you get functionally no loss in durability and luster and anything like that. You're doing it anyways. Why spend more money to do the same thing?

[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=629s) So now imagine saying to someone in the 1900s, "Hey, I know you like your big, heavy woven jacket, but what about this one? It's cheaper, lighter, more breathable, possibly warmer, super durable, and it looks great." They're probably going to be sold pretty darn fast. But it also didn't end there when they were selling this to the customer because Brown is using a knit fabric. So he has to make certain compromises on the design of his jacket. But what's crazy is those compromises that he had to make only made people like the jacket more.

[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=661s) The first compromise that Brown had to make, which by the way I'm the one saying compromise. I don't know if he actually thought of these as compromises, but the distinct binding that we have all around the pockets, all on the placket, all in the bottom of the hem. This woven binding adds durability, some structure so it doesn't bag out and reduces overall bulk, which I would assume was their main focus.

[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=682s) And everything is rounded because of the binding. They're trying to have it flow better so it doesn't have to keep going to points like it does right here. And then we have these, the old microphone destroyers, also known as snap buttons. Snap button technology debuted in the late 1800s, got popular by the 1900s.

[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=698s) Probably really important for Brown's beach cloth because a button hole might sag out over time and the button would just fall out since again this is a knit. This on the other hand is pressed and they have some reinforcement tape on the back which I guess they could have done for buttons. So let's also assume that this was a choice they had for convenience.

[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=714s) And finally, the greatest feature that Mr. Brown added was actually a subtraction. I just did not have a good transition to go to this. But without further ado, the vest, the most important product that Mr. Brown ever released. This is a Kapital version. So, it's a little more artsy fartsy than the original, but either way, the grand finale is the vest.

[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=732s) What's so important about the vest? Well, first off, vests are just awesome. Obviously, vests aren't really that popular anymore in 2026, but now I'm totally going to pick one up because they're so convenient. You get so much more movement in your arms. You could layer better. It's awesome. Probably going to grab one from I forget the first part of the name, but Baxter, local to me, really cool guy. Makes stuff for Filson.

You didn't have to buy a new jacket. You could put this on under your kit and it improved it because of all the qualities that we talked about before. All of a sudden, you take off your woven vest, put on this knit one, you're lighter, more breathable, more comfortable, everything like that. Bing, bang, boom, you want the whole Brown fleet cuz he made booties, hats, and everything like that.

[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=775s) And I can really see why. It's effectively a test drive to a revolutionary new fabric that changed the world forever. Synthetic fibers like polyester, nylon, stretch, and everything like that kind of railroaded Brown's beach cloth and killed the company.

[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=789s) But I think if that never happened, most people in most professions would gravitate to Brown's beach cloth or warp knit or even a weft knit fabric for their daily workwear. And now in 2026, that's kind of really going crazy. For athleisure, for sporting, for everything like that, people are mostly wearing knits.

[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=805s) And I have a theory that in 5 to 10 years, even pretty dangerous professions and stuff like that will be heavily based on knit clothing. And woven clothing is going to become specialty heritage stuff almost completely. And Mr. William W. Brown was kind of the first guy to be like, "This is it. This is the future."

[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIVM9e_lGU&t=820s) That is about it. I'll see you in the next video. I'm sampling Brown's Beachcloth for a super secret clothing project. And the Mammoth is releasing very soon along with all the denim. Tell you about that and a video coming soon.
