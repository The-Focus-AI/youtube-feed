# The Internet's Favorite Sweatshirts, Ranked.

## Summary

In this comprehensive sweatshirt ranking video, Michael polls his audience to discover the internet's favorite sweatshirts, then purchases and tests 15 different sweatshirts ranging from $17 (Amazon) to $391 (Wonder Looper from Japan). He ranks them from least to most popular, providing detailed analysis on construction, shrinkage percentages, fabric weight, and overall value.

The video explores the technical aspects of sweatshirt construction, including loop wheel knitting (which reduces stretching over time), reverse weave construction (cutting fabric on the cross grain to reduce length shrinkage), and the differences between cotton and polyester blends. Michael evaluates each sweatshirt based on comfort, durability, fit, and value for money.

Champion emerges as the top-ranked sweatshirt with 11.14% of votes, followed by Buzz Rickson at 6.19%. The video provides surprising discoveries like Camber (a made-in-USA brand that feels teleported from the 1990s) and American Giant (described as a "massive tank of a monster"). Michael also critiques brands like Russell and Abercrombie while praising premium Japanese options like The Real McCoy and Whitesville.

## Key Points

- **Poll Methodology** ([0:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=17s)) - Michael created a poll asking viewers which sweatshirt brands they love most, tallied votes, converted to percentages, and purchased the top brands.

- **Real McCoy Loop Wheel** ([1:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=67s)) - 10oz loop wheel construction reduces stretching over time because there's less tension during production; shrink percentage 5% width, 4.35% length.

- **Loop Wheel Explained** ([1:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=74s)) - Non-loop wheel knitwear is pulled with tension during knitting, causing stretch over time. Loop wheel uses gravity-fed production without tension motors.

- **Uniqlo Philosophy** ([2:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=146s)) - At $40, Uniqlo prioritizes making a decent, lasting sweatshirt without leaning into extreme comfort or durability; shrink 3.4% in length.

- **Camber - Made in USA** ([3:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=206s)) - Feels like it was "teleported from the 90s," very coarse texture, tight neck hole, uses reverse weave construction; shrink 12% width, 3% length.

- **Abercrombie's Softness Focus** ([5:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=351s)) - Prioritizes softness over everything with heavy washes that beat down the sweatshirt; 30% polyester count is a concern.

- **Wonder Looper Fox Fiber** ([7:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=423s)) - $391 limited edition 24oz sweatshirt uses Fox Fiber (first naturally colored cotton long enough to spin into yarn); shrink 0% (pre-washed).

- **Reigning Champ Issue** ([8:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=517s)) - Michael received one with a "bacony collar" (manufacturing defect), but notes the 12-14oz weight and nice dry feel make it one of the best on the list.

- **Champion Reverse Weave History** ([10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=609s)) - Champion invented reverse weave (cutting body fabric on cross grain) to reduce length shrinkage for football jerseys, adding side ribbing to remedy width tightness.

- **Russell Origins** ([11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=672s)) - Ben Russell invented the sweatshirt while playing football with an itchy wool jersey; modern Russell prioritizes cheapness over quality.

- **Whitesville Loop Wheel** ([12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=735s)) - Japanese loop wheel with 5x1 rib knit cuffs; very loose and soft, owned by Buzz Rickson's parent company.

- **American Giant** ([12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=778s)) - Described as a "massive tank of a monster" with reinforced arms, rib knitting on shoulders; great for bigger/taller people; shrink 1.8% length.

- **Brut (French Brand)** ([14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=893s)) - Names products "the best" and backs it up; very cropped modern fit, excellent ribbing; shrink 2.2% width.

- **Buzz Rickson #2** ([15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=955s)) - 6.19% of vote; checks every box for widest amount of people - nice heavyweight but not too heavy, soft but not crazy soft; shrink 1% length.

- **Champion #1** ([16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=990s)) - 11.14% of vote (almost double Buzz Rickson); reverse weave hoodie at $70 offers great value compared to $60 Abercrombie.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=0s) This is one of the best greatest sweatshirts on this list. I never heard of this brand before - this is a brand called American Giant. When I opened this massive tank of a monster from the box I just was like "oh what happened Reigning Champ?" It's time for the video, it's when you're supposed to show off.

[0:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=17s) What's the difference between a $391 sweatshirt I got from Japan and a $17 sweatshirt I got from Amazon? What about everything else in between? Both of these sweatshirts are in the internet's top 10 list of the greatest sweatshirts available right now. What I did was craft a poll to figure out what brands the internet loves the most. I got about a billion different suggestions from all of you, then I tallied up all the most popular brands, converted it to a number then to a percentage, and bought all of them.

[0:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=39s) You people are not cheap. Then I wore them, washed them, steamed them, ironed them, and Taylor stole some of them. Then I took them back and wrote down my thoughts for this video. So without any further ado, welcome to the coziest Iron Snail video in Iron Snail history. I'm eating grapes, I'm at home, sweatpants.

[0:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=58s) The video is going to be ordered from least popular to most popular by number of votes. I wanted to keep it to top 10 but I thought that the bottom three sweatshirts were also very important. I bought 15 sweatshirts total - couldn't stop myself.

[1:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=67s) This is the Real McCoy loop wheel sweater. It is 10oz and it's loop wheel. Non-loop wheel knitwear is pulled - it's very tense as it's being knit. And if you think of me pulling this sweatshirt for 3 hours or 4 hours, what's going to happen when I let go? It's going to be a little bit stretched out.

[1:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=84s) Loop wheel basically gravity fed - there's not a lot of tension motors and things pulling the yarn to do a faster form of production. So what you get from that is a sweatshirt that is inherently not stretched out and will also probably not stretch out as much over time because all of that tension that's being done by the machines isn't something you're going to replicate naturally with your movement because you fit inside the fabric. That's why it holds its shape, that's why people like it so much for t-shirts and sweatshirts.

[1:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=108s) Anyway though, Real McCoys is known for very accurate reproductions. This is no different. You will see the Dorito on the front and on the back - this is a real Dorito, actually it's not a real Dorito. So it's ribbing all the way through, there's an actual cut in the sweatshirt so this stretches easier, catches sweat easier.

[2:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=126s) We have a wide neckline which is a bit more old school as you'll see later. The real benefit for me with Real McCoy is that everything they do feels finished. There is a group of people that say "this is perfect, send it out the door." The Real McCoy shrink percentage: 5% in width, 4.35% in length.

[2:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=146s) Uniqlo also technically didn't make the list but I thought it was very important to put it on the list because Abercrombie did make it on the list at a shockingly high number and it's very important to see the difference in philosophy between a brand like Uniqlo and a brand like Abercrombie.

[2:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=158s) Overall though, this is a big reason I think as to why Uniqlo is so successful - because to me they chose all of the right things to prioritize with a budget $40 sweatshirt. There's no leaning in crazy comfort or crazy durability, it's just a pretty decent sweatshirt like what Uniqlo always does.

[2:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=175s) Two things to note though: on t-shirts I really care about a bound neck collar; on sweatshirts not so much. It's a heavier fabric so I'm not as worried about a bacon collar or distorted collar or anything like that. And I do like the look of both. That being said... oh what happened Reigning Champ? Uniqlo shrink percentage: 3.4% in length.

[3:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=206s) I was just digging through the trash trying to find the tag that came with this sweatshirt - can't find it. Taylor must have taken the trash out yesterday and not told me about it. Either way though, one of this is one of the best greatest sweatshirts on this list. I never heard of this brand before - this is a brand called Camber. It's a made in USA brand.

[3:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=215s) This sweatshirt feels like it was teleported from the 90s. I have a specific memory in my head of hugging my aunt who I think had an Arizona sweatshirt on and it felt exactly like this. Sweatshirt feels great, it's very coarse so if you don't like coarse sweatshirts you won't like this.

[3:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=229s) The neck hole is also very tight so if you have a big head - not trying to be silly - you will not make it through this sweatshirt, you will probably get stuck. And they're doing the same reverse weave cutting on the cross grain for the body fabric so it will shrink - we'll talk about that when we get to Champion. But cannot recommend this sweatshirt enough.

[4:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=245s) Camber shrinkage: 12% in width, 3% in length. One thing I forgot to note - this sweatshirt, this heathered one at least, this is 10% polyester. Typically I do not like polyester, still I wish this was 100% cotton, but polyester does add strength, it will aid in how fast the sweatshirt will dry. It does have a very storied history in sweatshirts and hoodies and that world - Champion was doing nylon fleeces for a very long time. So it's not out of the ordinary but something to know.

[4:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=276s) Hey guys, new iPhone season's upon us and you know your boy Mikey had to be the first in line to pick one up. But every good iPhone does need some protection, so I'm very happy to say that this video is sponsored by Arc Pulse. The Arc Pulse is precision crafted out of space-grade aluminum so not only is it incredibly light, it also sticks to your phone via friction - no adhesion necessary.

[5:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=351s) You may be wondering why this Abercrombie sweatshirt has the cuffs rolled and a toothpaste stain right there. The reason for that is because my girlfriend Taylor stole this sweatshirt immediately as it arrived. "Hold on, hold on. What did we just put on the second we got home?" "The cheapest. I like that one and the green one." "Oh don't talk about the green one yet."

[6:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=369s) Abercrombie is prioritizing softness over absolutely everything and they do that with a variety of washes that kind of beat this sweatshirt down over time. It's not a bad quality sweatshirt - it is a $60 sweatshirt - and I think that is because they're using higher quality cottons so they can beat them down more.

[6:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=385s) The thing that's kind of interesting and the reason I said Uniqlo should be on this list is because Uniqlo's approach seems to be more "let's make a basic sweatshirt that will last a very long time that has some oomph to it" and Abercrombie is "let's make the softest sweatshirt of all time."

[6:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=397s) Probably wouldn't recommend this sweater just for the 30% polyester count alone, but also washing it incredibly heavily is something I like to do myself over time. This feels like a sweatshirt that you bought that was worn already for like 10 years out the door. Abercrombie shrink percentage: [not specified] in length.

[7:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=423s) And now a sweatshirt that could not be more different than the Abercrombie sweatshirt but is ranked immediately after it - it's the Wonder Looper Double Heavyweight Fox Fiber crew neck t-shirt. Wonder Looper was ranked really high - I should have shown you one of their more regular offerings and not a limited edition $391 sweatshirt. They have other things, they're just always sold out.

[7:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=438s) So I will try and snag one of those. I'm friends with Basad, he gave me this sweatshirt for free. I'll try to get a regular one to show you because I never show regular Wonder Looper products. Four maybe even five times heavier than Abercrombie, two Champion sweatshirts in thickness - this is an absolute monster.

[7:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=457s) If you've never felt a 24oz sweatshirt you probably don't understand how heavy this actually is. You could see that it holds its shape when I hold it out like this. Now interestingly as I've said so many times before, this uses Fox Fiber which is the first ever naturally colored cotton that is a long enough staple to be easily spun into yarns and then made into garments like this.

[7:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=476s) That being said, it is small batch, it is expensive, and it's still not a long-staple cotton fiber so it needs to be blended with an extra long or just long staple cotton fiber so it's still strong, otherwise it wouldn't hold up, it wouldn't be tough enough to put on sweatshirts like this.

[8:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=490s) It's pest resistant, I think fire resistant, has a ton of insane qualities. And Fox Fiber is very interesting because this is Coyote 80 - this is the darkest Fox Fiber can get. But since it is so dark, if you wanted to dye this sweatshirt black you'd use something like 30 to 40% less dye to achieve a darker black than you could if you were just using a regular cotton. Wonder Looper shrink percentage: 0% (pre-washed).

[8:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=517s) Oh what happened Reigning Champ? It's a time for the video, this is when you're supposed to show off. I opened this sweatshirt from the box and said "oh no, we got a pretty bacony collar on this Reigning Champ sweatshirt." I don't think that's a typical thing, I think it was a miss. So I bet if I reached out to support I can get a new one.

[8:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=532s) The collar is tight enough where it's not super apparent - if it was a looser collar it would bacon up. For some reason it drives me absolutely nuts if the collar is a little wiggly, all day I just keep rubbing it with my finger trying to smooth it out. That being said I'm not going to judge the sweatshirt just based off of that because I don't think that's a typical thing.

[9:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=550s) First thing I will say: I should have sized down on this. I should have gotten an extra small Reigning Champ instead of a small. Besides all of that being said, this is an awesome sweatshirt - one of the best on the list. If the collar was not as bacony and I sized it right, it would be right up there with Camber and another brand that we have to talk about in a second.

[9:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=570s) It has a really nice dry feel. I think this is 12 to 13.5 to 14oz - nice and heavy, this is their original fleece. I also like that the ribbing on the side, the gusset, goes up into a triangle into the arm so you get some more mobility. Oh I feel like if someone from Reigning Champ is going to see this they're going to be like "okay great, YouTube guy got the one out of 800 that isn't right."

[9:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=599s) Reigning Champ shrink: [not specified] length. Good old Mikey fell for the eBay dupe. There's just a really good deal on a vintage Champion sweatshirt - says size small, I'm a size small. I think it's women's - vintage Champion and Russell.

[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=609s) Russell is also on this list. These were great made in USA reverse weave, which I guess we can talk about now. Champion got really famous for two things: one, reverse weave where they cut the main body fabric on the cross grain so it's to the side like this. And the reason it's like that is because when Champion sweatshirts were a football jersey, the players and the coaches didn't like that they shrank a lot lengthwise.

[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=628s) So Champion switched it this way and now they shrank a lot in the width. And Champion remedied the width shrinkage and the tightness - because there's less stretch horizontally - by adding this ribbing on the side. Those two things make up reverse weave, and that is part of the reason Champion became Champion.

[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=640s) The other part is they put a hood on these crew neck sweaters and all of a sudden you had the hoodies. All in all though, vintage 90s Champion - absolutely fantastic. Very dense, very nice feeling, still has polyester in it, that's still a thing, but no complaints there.

[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=659s) I did get eBay duped on the Champion sweatshirt, but luckily we also have the Russell. Mikey baby got duped again on the Russell. It hits me okay but I think this is a child's sweatshirt or men were very small or this is women's - I don't know.

[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=672s) I'm not going to yuck your yum if you like Russell for a specific reason - it is probably because they're, well first off they're the original sweatshirt maker. Ben Russell I believe it was, was playing football, had an itchy wool jersey on, and then made the sweatshirt.

[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=686s) And it seems to me from what I see, Russell went that way, Champion went that way. Champion kind of prioritized - like they do make cheaper things that may feel more like this Russell - but the reverse weave is really really nice. Russell seems like they went "how cheap can we go throughout."

[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=700s) If you were choosing between vintage Russell or vintage Champion, I'd probably say splurge for Champion. It's just a different beast. This pills a lot. I don't think you'd be super excited if you got it in the mail no matter how old - well maybe older ones are different. But I just don't think you'd be really excited if you got this in the mail.

[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=735s) We're back to one of the best sweatshirts on this list. There's one thing I don't like about it - it's aesthetic - but this is a fantastic quality loop wheel sweatshirt from Japan: Whitesville. Kind of a messed up thread at the cuff here and a messed up stitch.

[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=750s) So this is what New York sounds like. It's nice because it hasn't been too calm around here lately. Anyways, the real interesting thing about the Whitesville sweatshirt - it's loop wheel like we talked about before but it uses a 5x1 rib knit on the cuff, on the hem, and on the collar.

[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=767s) Which I'm sorry, what is happening? Don't worry guys, I saw it, it fix it. Just a few quick discussion I had to have. 5x1 rib knit on the cuffs, on hem, and everything like that - you either like it or you don't. It's not my favorite, I wish it was a 2x1 or 1x1 or something like that.

[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=778s) It's also very very loose and very very soft. If you're looking for a very very soft high quality sweatshirt - and not soft as in silky, soft as in like kind of fluffy and cozy - you go Whitesville. You go this next brand: pre-washed American Giant.

[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=793s) When I opened this massive tank of a monster from the box I just was like "holy crap, this is the craziest sweatshirt I've ever felt in my life." First off, reinforced arms. Also rib knitting on the shoulders for more flexibility. The hood is also just freaking monster.

[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=811s) The way it's sewn around here feels very American. Like if you wear this, you probably wear - which is not an American brand - you probably wear Iron Heart denim, you wear PNW boots, you just want the epitome of incredibly heavy overbuilt products. One of the best sweatshirts on this list, especially if you're a bigger guy, especially if you're tall actually. American Giant shrinkage: 1.8% in length.

[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=843s) Russell okay, here's Russell part two. This is the cheapest sweatshirt on the list so it's hard - I can't compare it to a $150 sweatshirt and be like "it's lightweight, it uses polyester" - that wouldn't be that fair would it. It looks like Russell kind of stayed with the philosophy of like "these are basically football jerseys, they should be cheap, so we'll start to use polyester or we'll do this to make it cheaper."

[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=866s) It feels like the old Russell sweatshirt to be honest. I bet this will pill over time. I splurged - I got the fancy premium cotton Cotton Rich Blend which is 35% polyester, 65% cotton. It's a very polyester feeling sweatshirt. You can actually if you go out into the sun or catch it at the right light, you could see the shine from the polyester actually on this sweatshirt.

[14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=884s) Someone that buys a Russell probably wants the cheapest sweatshirt possible that will hold up, that they can just wear around the house or throw out and not really care about that much. That's who Russell goes after. Russell shrink percentage: 1.25% in width, 2% in length.

[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=893s) Next up we have a small French brand called - I really like them, they make a great sweatshirt - I can't pronounce their name perfectly: Brut, Brute, Brut. Definitely not Brut. I've been told Brut's marketing is very interesting because they just named their stuff "the best" - the best down jacket, the best sweatshirt, the best hoodie.

[15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=911s) And if you say you're the best, you have to at least be pretty close to the top of being the best, and I would say they are. I'd say they totally back it up. This is a great sweatshirt, I got it on sale I will say. Very high quality, very modern fit, very highly cropped.

[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=922s) A lot of Brut stuff is very cropped. If you're tall you're probably going to want to size up. This is the sleeve on someone that's 5'9" wearing a size small - usually sleeves are a little big on me. The ribbing feels excellent to the point where I wonder if it's a synthetic blend. It has a bit of that dry feel I usually feel with synthetic blends. No complaints, one of the best on this list - maybe number two, maybe number three. Brut shrink percentage: 2.2% in width.

[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=955s) Buzz Rickson - not a company I expected to be second on the list: 6.19% of the vote. I can see why the Buzz Rickson made it to second most popular on the list. It checks every single box probably for the widest amount of people. It's a nice heavyweight but it's not too heavy. It's soft but not crazy soft.

[16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=971s) Really its main competitor is owned by its parent company - Whitesville. And to me it would come down to do you like the 5x1 rib knit cuff? If you do, go Whitesville. If you don't, Buzz Rickson. Really fantastic value for the money, great fit, little more constricted than the Whitesville. Buzz Rickson shrink percentage: 1% in length.

[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=990s) And finally at the top of this list with almost double the amount of votes as Buzz Rickson - 11.14% is of course Champion. Champion is a brand where I feel like they did you good. You know they're that one guy that was super successful but then came back to the neighborhood and was the same guy as before and was like "what's up guys, how's it going?" Super successful now but doesn't bother me.

[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=1016s) This 90s made in USA sweatshirt - could not tell you the... could I? Okay, I will say this specific 90s sweatshirt does feel a little rougher, a little bit more robust than this Champion that I'm wearing right now. I will say that. So what, the guy came back to the neighborhood, he changed a little bit.

[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=1025s) Just kidding. Abercrombie is $60, this reverse weave hoodie is $70, and to me they're light years different in quality and feel. Champion still has that durable knitwear thing in their bones and I think they really make it clear with the reverse weave series specifically.

[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=1041s) When I was first getting into clothes, that was the top thing on my Christmas list. I asked my parents I just want a reverse weave Champion sweatshirt and it was this, this was what I got from my parents. Nothing to really complain about. That's why Champion is so high up on this list, because what they are making is a great value compared to what we are seeing in the general landscape.

[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=1058s) Would I say it's $40 better than Uniqlo reverse weave? Yeah. It seems like Champion knows from a marketing perspective or a brand perspective why they are Champion and they hold that up with reverse weave and that is why they're staying at the top and getting so many votes.

[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=1073s) Great, great. That's uh, that's it. It's very hard to rank things because it's my opinion - you may differ on weight and feel and stuff like that - but this would be how I would rank things according to overall value to me.

[18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9_-Qbmzsk&t=1084s) But either way, if you want to do part two let me know - it will be called "Michael's Revenge" and I will wreak havoc on the world of sweatshirts. But other than that, I will see you next week. Very big announcement coming up, not related to this channel, related to my personal life. You'll be shocked - well you might not be.
