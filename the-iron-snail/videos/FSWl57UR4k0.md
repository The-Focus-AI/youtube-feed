# I've Reviewed 100+ T-shirts. Here Are The Best Ones.

## Summary

After years of accumulating data on t-shirts - measuring, washing, stress-washing, tracking torque and shrinkage - Michael presents his definitive guide to the greatest t-shirts organized into five categories: All-Arounders, Japan's Might, The Heavyweights, The Supremes, and Best Values.

The video reveals obsessive attention to detail: checking whether shirts lay flat (no twist), measuring shrinkage percentages after washing, noting collar construction and whether it's triple-stitched. Michael explains concepts like torque (when the shirt body twists over time) and why ring-spun combed cotton matters.

Key takeaways include Japanese t-shirts dominating the high-end market through loopwheel knitting, American brands like American Giant making incredibly durable heavyweights, and budget options like Uniqlo and House of Blanks offering remarkable quality for price.

## Key Points

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=0s) I like to call this t-shirt old faithful. This is why it's so good. We have a triple stitched bound collar. And look at this specifically right here. See how I can lay the t-shirt down perfectly flat? There's no twist or anything.

[0:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=15s) Look at this. See how the entire shirt is twisting near the underarm and this seam line is coming towards the front of the shirt. And the torque on this t-shirt actually isn't bad at all. And you would never notice. It's well within normal tolerances and everything like that. But it's a little cool thing to notice when you're collecting data points about the world's greatest t-shirts.

[0:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=35s) Over the past few years, I have accidentally made it my goal to try and find the greatest t-shirts ever known to humankind. This video is an amalgamation of my findings thus far.

[0:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=50s) I took all of our greatest hits from the other videos and some newcomers. I first measured them, then I washed them to their care instructions. Then I stress-washed them, measured the differences, measured torque, everything that I possibly could to see what are the winners. And that is why we're here today.

[1:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=70s) I divided all of our winners into five distinct sections. This is section number one, the all-arounders. Section number two, Japan's might. Three, the toughest and heaviest monsters. Four, the supremes. And five, hands down, the best possible deals in t-shirt history.

[1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=90s) Welcome to the absolute mega t-shirt showdown 2025. Michael Christie, Iron Snail, and you're the snails. What's up, snails? Mikey here. Hope everybody's doing well. Good to see you again. Hope you're having a lovely day. It's a beautiful, cozy, rainy day.

[1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=110s) Yesterday, it was super rainy and cozy as I was getting everything ready. So, we're going to be super chill this video as I just absolutely annihilate a massive stack of t-shirts and tell you all about them.

[2:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=125s) There will be five categories in total. Our first category is the all-arounders, a series of t-shirts that no matter what, I just can't turn my nose away from. We have a limited budget, limited time, all-arounders are where we're spending it.

[2:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=150s) J. Press x American Trench: this collaboration hits the sweet spot of quality and accessibility. Great construction, reasonable price, available when you need it.

[2:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=165s) Buck Mason ToughKnit: the name says it all. This shirt holds up. Not the most luxurious hand feel but durable and consistent. A workhorse t-shirt.

[3:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=180s) 3Sixteen Heavyweight Two Pack: buying in pairs saves money and the quality justifies the price per shirt. American-made, good weight, reliable construction.

[3:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=210s) Now entering Japan's Might territory. Japanese t-shirt makers are operating on a different level. The attention to detail, the fabric quality, the construction techniques - it's obsessive.

[4:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=240s) Loopwheel knitting is the key. These slow, vintage machines produce fabric with a distinctive soft hand and natural stretch recovery that modern high-speed knitting can't replicate. Takes forever to make, which is why it's expensive.

[4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=270s) Iron Heart Loopwheel: top tier. They offer a regular length and a longer variant if you need the extra coverage. The fabric is exceptional - dense but not stiff, soft but durable.

[5:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=300s) Warehouse 4601: shop around based on your country for the best price. Self Edge carries them in the US but international options may be better depending on where you are. The construction rivals anything at double the price.

[5:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=330s) Wonder Looper ELS: uses recycled cotton slub for a unique texture. ELS (extra-long staple) cotton means finer, stronger yarn. The environmental angle is bonus.

[6:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=360s) Samurai SJST-M solid t-shirt: from the denim brand known for heavyweight obsession. They bring the same philosophy to t-shirts.

[6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=390s) Allevol: less known but excellent Japanese option. Worth seeking out if you're diving into the Japanese t-shirt world.

[7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=420s) Now the Heavyweights. These shirts could stop bullets. Not literally. But they're built like tanks.

[7:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=435s) The Real McCoys Buco: Japanese reproduction brand making military and vintage-inspired clothing. Their Buco t-shirts are dense, heavy, and feel like they'll last forever.

[7:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=465s) The Flat Head: obsessive Japanese brand. Every detail considered. The t-shirts reflect their denim philosophy - overkill construction in the best way.

[8:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=480s) American Giant Everest T-Shirt: made in USA heavyweight. American Giant's thing is durable American manufacturing, and the Everest delivers. Not subtle, not soft, just solid.

[8:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=510s) Moving to the Supremes. These are the t-shirts that balance everything - construction, fabric, fit, details - into something special.

[9:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=540s) Merz B. Schwanen 2M15: the 2M15 is their modified version of the 215 with different details. German manufacturing with attention to every element. The fabric has character.

[9:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=570s) Asket: Swedish brand with transparent pricing showing exactly what you pay for materials, labor, profit. The t-shirt itself is excellent - refined but not fussy.

[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=600s) Lady White Co. Our T-Shirt: made in LA. The drape is beautiful, the construction precise, the overall effect effortless. My personal favorite for daily wear.

[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=630s) Knickerbocker Basics: American-made with quality focus. Not as hyped as some but delivers consistently.

[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=660s) Finally, Best Values. These prove you don't need to spend a fortune for quality.

[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=675s) Uniqlo: their heavyweight is remarkable for the price. Not everything they make is great but this specific shirt punches way above its weight class.

[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=690s) Muji: washed heavyweight option. Similar philosophy to Uniqlo but different aesthetic. Worth comparing to see which fits your style.

[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=705s) The Front General Store FGS Originals Heavy Weight T-Shirt: small operation making quality basics at reasonable prices.

[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=720s) House of Blanks Heavyweight: this might be the best pure value in the video. Quality that rivals shirts at 2-3x the price. If budget matters, start here.

[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=750s) Items not featured in video but worth mentioning: WiesMade Bolinas Tee is great for tall and skinny folks, 100% American-made. Shrink was 3.61% x 1.79%, moderate to heavy torque, combed/ring-spun cotton.

[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=780s) Healthknit Tompkins Jersey Crew: cropped, modern, but floats in the perfect range between light and medium weight. Very flowing. Shrink 0% x 3.06%, light torque.

[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=810s) Freenote Cloth 9oz Tee: classic Freenote. Heavy, drapes well, looser knit, comfortable feeling. Shrink -1.23% x 1.92% (stretched from line dry and didn't recover), little to no torque.

[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=840s) P&Co Crafted Heavyweight: interlock knit! Super smooth, comfortable, stretchy, and bouncy. Shrink 0% x 1.96%, little to no torque.

[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=870s) Haven Suvin Cotton Jersey: interlock knit! Super smooth, silky, comfortable, stretchy, and bouncy. Uses some of the rarest cotton on the planet, and you can feel it. Shrink -2.47% x 2.74% (stretched from line dry), light torque.

[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=900s) That's the mega t-shirt breakdown. Whatever your budget, whatever your style preference, something here will work. The key is matching what you need to what each shirt offers.

[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=930s) Thanks for watching! Links to everything in the description. If you want the short answer: Lady White for everyday luxury, House of Blanks for value, Iron Heart if you want the best Japan offers.

[16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWl57UR4k0&t=960s) See you in the next one. Keep wearing good t-shirts.
