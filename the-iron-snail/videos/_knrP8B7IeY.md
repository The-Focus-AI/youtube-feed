# My Favorite 24 Thrifted* Fall Pick-Ups.

## Summary

Michael announces a major life change while showcasing 24 thrifted fall pieces - he and Taylor are leaving New York City and moving to Portland, Maine. The video serves as both a clothing haul and a farewell to his favorite outdoor spots in New York and New Jersey, filmed across three different locations in the woods.

The highlight of the video is the unveiling of the first product from The Iron Snail's knitwear division - the "Billy Goat" sweater made from 100% Targhee sheep's wool. Michael explains the unique properties of this wool, developed in 1930s Idaho, which combines the softness of Rambouillet with the durability of Lincoln and Corriedale breeds. The sweater prioritizes durability while maintaining next-to-skin softness.

The thrifted pieces range from rare vintage finds like a made-in-Canada blanket-lined Carhartt denim jacket to modern brands like Lady White and Filson. Michael discusses the evolution of brands like Columbia (from a 1960s knitwear company to NASA insulation supplier) and critiques Filson's pricing strategy of inflating retail prices to make sales seem more attractive.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=0s) This is a rare made in Canada blanket lined Carhartt denim jacket one of my all-time favorites. These are Ralph Lauren pants very wide very pleated very corduroy and what is this it's a knit jacket made from silk and baby alpaca on a tiny Irish island with a population of 184 people most of whom I assume made this piece.

[0:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=20s) That is a vintage almost perfect suede jacket that's the Carhartt I talked about like 2 seconds ago that is my first ever sports coat it's a one of one made in London wool Bedford cloth horn buttoned coat from my favorite brand that doesn't fit me that's my go Taylor.

[0:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=33s) And this you mere Mortals is the first ever product from the iron snail knitting division code name Billy Goat there's actually going to be two different sweaters in five different colors but they're not all finished yet so this is the only one I have. Welcome to 24 of my favorite thrifted fall Essentials sorry I am allergic to probably 23 of the thrifted Fall Essentials.

[0:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=50s) This is going to be a 24 piece lightning round of a video but it's a little different than normal this time because last week I said I'll see you next week very big announcement coming up not related to this channel related to my personal life and now hello everyone it's Michael remember last video when I said I had news a lot of you thought it was going to be that I'm proposing to Taylor there will be a 12 part series on suit jackets and the best wool to use for pants when that time comes.

[1:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=75s) In the meantime we're leaving New York Taylor and I today well tomorrow but this is my last day in New York and I uh I love New York so I don't particularly know how I feel about it. I thought it would be fun if you and I went on a walk on all my favorite trails and paths and the woods and stuff like that that I will no longer be going to.

[1:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=93s) Either way though you're probably wondering where the heck are we moving here we're moving to these used to say Maine on the back of them that would have worked but much better we're moving to Portland Maine. First place on our list is the oyster Zone this is not the oyster Zone we have to walk there we're going to three different locations that I have to get.

[1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=110s) Me when I first showed this to Taylor she thought I was joking I'm not joking I think this is I think I could make a shearling vest work maybe if this was the rise of my pants was a little high this is a little lighter nice gray sweatshirt or something. I got this for 20 30 bucks it's a Field Master brand this is suede with probably a polyester lining on the inside so it's not real shearling sadly I do need to get a real shearling piece.

[2:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=134s) Maybe Taylor thought it was a costume because I showed it to her while I was wearing a western shirt and just it was in my underwear. While we're on the general subject vests I got this pretty sweet one from North Sare which is a company that still exists it's a New Zealand company 100% Shetland wool it's actually very rarely do I get a piece on eBay that exceeds my expectations beyond my expectations.

[2:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=154s) It doesn't look like a huge brand but North Sare still exists and they make a really cool uh quarter zip that I would love to buy. The reason I'm into vest is because I you know when you're moving you kind of remap your life you're like oh I'm going to become a marathon runner now that I live in Portland Maine I'm I would like to buy a bike and bike around and I picture myself riding a bike in Maine with a vest on and then you know slowly we'll add the arms on but not make it a full sweater or something like that.

[2:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=178s) I got a cardigan and I thought the brand was Thunderbird but turns out the brand is Columbia early Columbia this is probably from the 1960s it's a little itchy but still beautiful. The coolest part is that's Columbia the Columbia now is so different they started off as a hat company then they made knitwear with cotton and wool and now they literally have insulation from their company being used by NASA.

[3:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=201s) This next sweater is from a brand called Lio from California I don't believe they exist anymore it's a vintage ski sweater. The sweater is not the softest at all it's actually a little rough you're probably going to want a base layer with it but the Yarns feel absolutely beautiful if it was on the rack today I would assume it would be $300 to $400 if not more because of how nice it feels.

[3:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=218s) Then we get to our first bummer of the day this beautiful Gap sweatshirt collar I really want a collared cardigan or collared sweater but uh it's it's very small it kind of fits Taylor she looks very cute in it so that's a bonus. I'm just saying like it's a little Broad in it's meant for like a big chested man yeah it does look a little it's like a you look a cute little maid girl now.

[4:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=242s) Okay moving on this piece I was a little disappointed by not because of the quality of it the quality of it beautiful but because I didn't know it was a spring summer thing I really like Autumn Fall Winter things but you know thicker beefier wool things but it is from the most remote knitting brand in the world according to Mr Porter.

[4:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=262s) I was going to do the name reveal on the top of this tree the brand is Inis Meain which is a small Ireland island with a population of like 186 people or something like that I don't know the current population and someone may have died and they make some of the most beautiful incredibly expensive knitwear that I've ever seen in my life so I'll probably never wear this piece I'll probably sell it put on eBay it's too slouchy makes me feel very old when I wear it like an old tired man.

[4:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=287s) So if any of you are old tired men that are... This video is sponsored by Vaer watches. Hello watch nerds and lovers this is a GMT watch a watch that can tell three different time zones at the exact same time here is how this is a quartz 39mm Vaer G2 Meridian water resistant up to 500 M and assembled in the USA.

[5:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=306s) I'm assuming everybody here knows how to tell time but you might not know what that red hour hand is it can tell us 24-hour time with no changes but if we rotate our bezel 3 hours back from Eastern Standard time we get San Francisco time now you'll see the hour hand tells us our local time and the red GMT hand tells us San Francisco time in the 24-hour format.

[5:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=327s) Michael that is so crazy but also we can do three time zones simply set the GMT hand to GMT time the hour hand to your time and rotate the bezel so the GMT hand points to the third time zone's time San Francisco for this example so now if we look at the hour hand it's our local time if we look at what the GMT hand is pointing to on the bezel that's our second time zone and the GMT hand itself if we pretend that the bezel wasn't rotated points to GMT time at the same time.

[5:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=357s) Thank you very much to Vaer for sponsoring this video in my very echoey apartment you can check out the G2 Meridian and its fancier brother down below.

[6:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=364s) Finally the piece de resistance my own knitwear piece the first ever piece from the iron snail knitting division let me introduce you formally to the billy goat. Well there will be two Billy Goats this year there's this is the only one that's finished right now the main thinking behind the construction of the billy goat was to maximize durability while keeping softness.

[6:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=383s) There is a certain level where most people don't need something to be even softer because if it is even softer it's more delicate and we now very very soft wools Merino is an incredible example but what if you had something that was imperceptibly coarser than Merino that would last you longer would hold its shape better would be a little springier.

[6:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=403s) So the Billy Goat is made from 100% Targhee sheep's wool you're probably asking what is Targhee sheep in the 1930s in Idaho the Targhee sheep was developed to be a dual purpose breed so you could eat it or you could use its wool but what's very cool about the Targhee sheep is that it's kind of the greatest hits of all of the sheep so it has Rambouillet in its blood which is why it has very soft fine wool but it also has Lincoln and Corriedale.

[7:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=430s) So all that is to say the fiber the wool fiber is long and thicker than Merino and longer and thicker means more durable but also since it has that Rambouillet in there it's very soft it's very springy and you can wear it next to skin. To the point where when I was talking to the Spinners that I'm working with also in Wyoming they said that they have to size the sweaters they make differently if they're using Merino versus what they're using Rambouillet because of the stretch factor that Merino has when Rambouillet just doesn't it snaps back to shape much easier.

[7:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=455s) First location down goodbye oyster Zone very nice to film you.

[7:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=465s) While we're making our way to the spot in the woods I figured we can pour some out for the homies two pieces that sadly I really wanted to add to the collection but they are totally gone forever this amazing S.E.H. Kelly bacon I think that's how you say it uh I wanted that so bad found for a good price online and the seller's being really nice but he keeps updating me being like hey man looks uh we haven't USPS hasn't updated this in 20 days and I'm like it's gone dude it's gone.

[8:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=491s) Quick edit it landed in Brooklyn but I still don't have it so I will send it to you personally in the winter time so you can check it out I love their stuff S.E.H. Kelly is unbelievable which is also why I tried to snag this really beautiful wool Bedford cord S.E.H. Kelly one of one I think they call it the SB jacket but a sports coat it's coming from Germany so maybe maybe it will come.

[8:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=512s) Edit it did obviously come and it's beautiful but doesn't fit me so Taylor graciously said she would model it for us no no I think oh that's mine that's mine hands out of pockets by your side pretend you know what I do in videos stop away this I think it looks great on you yeah I know it fits me really well.

[8:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=526s) Oh oh no they've removed my favorite stump every time I'd come here I'd sit on the stump at least I think it was right here could it's definitely not that there's no way right.

[9:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=540s) The eBay is 1940s 1950s I think it's 1950s 1960s field coat which is unbelievable although the fit's like a little weird it's a little too wide but not long enough in the arm so it has this kind of like splay out thing that oh and the collar is they were clearly very worried that the jacket collar was going to be too stiff with the layer of canvas and corduroy so they used a very light layer of canvas and but it's too light.

[9:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=565s) Speaking of old canvas uh we got some pants in the lineup which all you little trendy boys and girls are going to love because they're pleated super wide I love them Ralph Lauren Andrew pants double pleated. I watched a documentary on Ralph Lauren a few nights ago I actually fell asleep in the middle of it not because it was bad I was just a little um sleep deprived but these pants are awesome admittedly I did think I was buying khakis those are clearly gray pants and the description does say gray so totally my fault.

[9:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=591s) Bru is a really great brand I talked about them last video and the sweatshirt that I talked about is what I'm talking about now it's just a really great color Taylor and I watch '90s TV shows basically every night before we go to bed makes me feel like I'm living in the 99s like a comfy cozy kind of loud color that's still nice.

[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=605s) But the real sweatshirt killer brand which we will probably do on part two of sweatshirts is of course Lady White. I bought this sweatshirt for the last video but I didn't include it because of time and it didn't make the list and everything like that which you all voted for by the way you talk to me like I didn't include your favorite sweatshirt you didn't vote enough. Lady White's 1944 sweatshirt unbelievable honestly I think if Lady White had their way they would leave a little mint on your pillow after you bought something from them.

[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=629s) The Taylor Stitch division shirt in Birch it has burnt corozo nut buttons which is why it's a little darker brown on the outside beautiful texture goes with uh this outfit that I wore out recently with Taylor to an improv comedy show UCB.

[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=640s) Then maybe very surprisingly very not well we actually have two pieces from Filson. Filson has been undergoing a lot of changes recently go on the Filson subreddit if you'd like to read about it more I have Filson's wool work jacket and their Shortline tin cloth Cruiser they're both amazing pieces absolutely outstanding quality.

[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=657s) The tough part about Filson though is the way that they're doing business now they crank prices up a lot so that way they can put them on sale and you're like oh my gosh which I did I bought this duffel bag the first time they did a sale because I couldn't believe that the sale was so good they got me but what makes it harder to recommend Filson is that their sale price should be around where they should be selling their pieces at not the retail price so you have to get them on sale but even then they're kind of expensive.

[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=678s) So if you really like Filson they have an amazing history and their stuff still is very high quality but the whole like is it a deal thing they're not the strongest in that.

[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=687s) Suit really got to pick up the pace cuz we got to get to one more location but goodbye location number two I'm sorry that I did not have a name for you it was a pleasure to film in you for the years we have less than an hour we have to go to the water and we have to go to my absolute favorite place but this is location three let's get going.

[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=712s) This is the you know the more I film or the closer I get to finish filming the more I realize that I'm going to go home get a U-Haul and leave. I am one who always thinks they have much more time than they do have and then I end up scrambling and realizing that it's over when I thought something I had more time it already was over.

[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=734s) We're going to hit the denim world for a second if you don't mind Levi 501s made in USA vintage 90s I kind of got these as a holdover pair a light wash pair uh I of course have my own jeans but I had to send all of mine to the manufacturer so they could use them as a sample for production which should be coming out very very soon by the way to everybody that bought one thank you.

[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=753s) Ralph Lauren denim jacket I talked about this last year but one of the best cold weather colder weather denim jackets ever awesome fit cool quarter collar cool lining really liking Ralph Lauren lately I watched a documentary on him but I fell asleep.

[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=765s) The prolog jacket is getting a friend this coming year or maybe even two I have been feverishly looking on Vintage sites vintage Instagrams and everything to find interesting denim jackets see what people are doing that was really spicy.

[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=778s) Upon doing that I found Tough Nut which is this jacket really really cool jacket clearly modified type two which is very cool no hand warmer pockets cotton threads that are kind of busting out it has holes everywhere the construction on the back is totally weird I would never reference that construction I think it looks very bad.

[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=794s) On the topic of overshirts we have a total Miss and then a total win the total Miss is vintage Boy Scouts red overshirt 85% wool 15% nylon classic The Real McCoy's does one that's absolutely stunning but it's like $350 or something dollar this I paid 40 bucks for.

[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=809s) In the win category though Imogene and Willie is making a sawtooth they may have done this before but a sawtooth denim shirt the best over shirt that I've ever worn in my entire life and then they came out with the red and green flannels and the same cut I would buy those too if I wasn't spending a trillion dollars on this move.

[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=823s) This might be my second or third favorite Storm Rider denim jacket I have a Lee Storm Rider which I guess technically made the list cuz I just mentioned it but it's a little too long I don't really like the fit of it I need to get another one that fits me a little bit better.

[13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=834s) But I also have this made in Canada Carhartt denim jacket with unbranded buttons I thought it was fake I don't know what year it's from Carhartt like their name out apparently during the Great Depression and it took them a long time to get all of those licenses back either way this jacket just it's a little too short it's 22 in Long 21 in long so you got to wear it with really high-waisted pants if you're going to wear it but something about it is just really perfect.

[14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=855s) We have exactly 30 minutes before I need to leave yeah let me know what the plan is with the storage unit um yeah okay love you bye I'm going to the last my last favorite spot in the woods and then I'll be home I'll go get the U-Haul.

[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=869s) Ah we're pretty much out of time I don't even don't have a lot of time but this is it this is uh the best place in New Jersey at least my favorite place I always wanted to uh take Taylor here after work one day and just sit have a picnic.

[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=885s) Luckily while filming this video I realized that all the favorite places I had to check off the Box before I left New York and New Jersey were in the woods and were very inconvenient for me to get to because I live in New York City so that made me a lot more excited about Maine very excited to go there.

[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=900s) Either way that's not why we're here here what's the final piece Mikey boy the final piece is this I should I just stand is this suede jacket I got from Grailed nice and old made by Mountain Goat company in Canada I had a few other suede pieces over the years that were made in Canada and everything that's coming out of there that's lined with something has been really exceptional.

[15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knrP8B7IeY&t=919s) But either way that's it that's the end of New York and New Jersey as we all know it because I'm leaving I actually have five more minutes so I want to sit here for 5. Go you know what actually I think I'm great Goodbye old apartment goodbye Taylor.
