# Is Patagonia Really THAT Good?

## Summary

After reading two books on Patagonia, acquiring over $4,000 in their equipment, going undercover to test their Worn Wear program, and testing vintage versus new gear, Michael delivers a comprehensive verdict on whether Patagonia lives up to its legendary reputation. The video grapples with the inherent contradiction of an "environmentally sustainable" brand whose products are largely synthetic.

Michael traces Patagonia's origins from Yvon Chouinard's climbing gear company through their invention of Synchilla fleece (discovered from football jersey fabric) and the evolution of their iconic Retro-X. He compares 1988, 2000s, and 2023 versions of the same jacket to determine if "new Patagonia isn't as good" is myth or reality. The findings are nuanced - some products have declined, others improved, and the brand's environmental claims deserve scrutiny given that 65% of the world's clothing is synthetic and 35% of ocean pollution comes from synthetic clothing.

The video ultimately argues that while Patagonia deserves credit for many innovations and their warranty/repair programs, the internet's perception of them as environmentally perfect is oversimplified.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=0s) This is a 1970s Patagonia reverse pile cardigan. It was made from toilet bowl covers. Actually, toilet bowl covers that you see from the 70s, same exact material. That is why it's this weird color, and that's why it was this weird blue color.

[0:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=15s) This is a Synchilla fleece. And these pockets originally were curved to kind of mimic the shape of this outer pocket inwards. So, if you put sunglasses in here, it was supposed to put the sunglasses at an angle so they wouldn't fall into your armpit. Nowadays, I don't think they do that same pocket construction.

[0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=30s) Patagonia, Patagonia, Patagonia, Patagonia. I have lost my mind trying to make this video. This is the third time I'm filming it. The first one was 40 minutes long. The second one, there was a torrential downpour. The third one, this one is going to be really good. It's going to be the best video that I've ever made in my entire life.

[0:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=35s) Taylor said if I go out to film this video one more time, she's going to break up with me. So, I got to get it right. I literally just woke up. I jumped out of bed and was like, "Babe, I got to go film the Patagonia video again."

[0:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=45s) I've read two books on the brand. I acquired over $4,000 in Patagonia equipment. I went undercover to test one of their environmentally friendly programs and I tested all of the old Patagonia gear versus new Patagonia gear to see if it's actually any better cuz that's what the internet says. New Patagonia is not as good. I don't know if I believe them on that, but I might after the testing.

[1:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=65s) So, hello. I've had so much trouble making this video because Patagonia is one of the weirdest brands out there on the planet. They are touted as the most environmentally sustainable, friendly, crazy brand, but basically all of their clothing is synthetic.

[1:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=80s) 65% of the entire world's clothing is synthetic. And 35% of the pollution in the ocean is because of synthetic clothing. And one of their flagship fabrics is Synchilla, which Patagonia first discovered this fabric. I think it was on football jerseys or soccer jerseys. And now it's one of their flagship fabrics.

[1:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=105s) This one is covered in mint oils so you don't smell bad. And this is where the real investigation begins. Because if you look at Patagonia's history, they've done incredible things for outdoor gear innovation. But the environmental narrative is more complex than the branding suggests.

[2:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=120s) Let's start with what they do well. The Worn Wear program is genuinely good. They'll repair your stuff, they sell used gear at reduced prices, and they encourage longevity over replacement. That's real.

[2:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=150s) Their warranty is legendary. If something breaks, they fix it. If they can't fix it, they replace it. I've seen jackets from the 80s still being serviced. That commitment to longevity is environmental action in practice.

[3:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=180s) But here's where it gets complicated. They use recycled polyester, which sounds great. But recycled polyester still sheds microplastics. Every wash, tiny plastic fibers go down the drain and into the ocean. The environmental benefit of recycling is partially offset by ongoing pollution.

[3:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=210s) Now let's look at specific products. I have a 2023 Retro-X in blue. I have what I believe is a 1988 Retro-X. And I have a 2000s version. Same jacket, three eras. Let's see if quality declined.

[4:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=240s) The 1988 version feels denser. The pile is tighter, the construction heavier. The 2000s version is a bit lighter but still substantial. The 2023 version is noticeably lighter weight, and the pile feels less dense. Is that bad? Not necessarily - it might be more packable, more versatile for active use.

[4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=270s) But if you want that tank-like heritage feel, the vintage versions deliver it in a way the new ones don't. This isn't decline - it's a design choice. Whether it's the right choice depends on what you want.

[5:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=300s) The 2006 Rhythm Jacket I have shows a middle period of Patagonia production. Solid construction, interesting design details, nothing that screams either excellence or decline.

[5:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=330s) Point Reyes Gi Pants are an interesting case study. Hemp and organic cotton blend. These are Patagonia trying to move beyond synthetics. The construction is good, the materials are genuinely more sustainable than polyester.

[6:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=360s) The Synchilla Fleece remains a solid product. Not revolutionary anymore - every brand makes fleece now - but competent. The mint oil treatment for odor control is a nice touch that actually works.

[6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=390s) Better Sweater - this is probably their best-selling fleece. I've had multiple versions over the years. The current version is fine. Not dramatically better or worse than previous versions. Just consistent.

[7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=420s) Where I notice real decline is in some of their older specialty pieces. The recycled wool shirt I have is nice but doesn't match the quality of their vintage wool sweater from the 80s. That vintage piece is special - tight knit, beautiful wool, clearly made with more care.

[7:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=450s) The 50th Anniversary Rugby Sweater shows they can still make excellent heritage pieces when they want to. Limited runs seem to get more attention than mainline products.

[8:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=480s) Worn Wear testing: I went undercover to their program. Brought in pieces with issues. The repair process was smooth, the turnaround reasonable, the quality of repairs good. This is a program that actually works as advertised.

[8:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=510s) The used gear they sell through Worn Wear is priced fairly. You can find excellent vintage pieces at 40-60% of original retail. If you're price-conscious, this is a great way to buy Patagonia.

[9:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=540s) Now the environmental claims. Patagonia gives 1% of sales to environmental causes. They've pushed suppliers toward better practices. They've invested in regenerative organic farming. These are real commitments.

[9:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=570s) But they're still fundamentally a clothing company encouraging consumption. The most environmental choice is often to buy nothing, or buy used. Patagonia acknowledges this somewhat - "Don't Buy This Jacket" was a famous campaign - but they're still trying to sell you things.

[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=600s) The Gi Pants Point Reyes are $100. For hemp/organic cotton pants, that's reasonable. The construction justifies the price. But you could also buy used pants for $10 and that would be more sustainable.

[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=630s) Their supply chain transparency is better than most brands. They publish supplier lists, they audit factories, they acknowledge problems when found. That's more than fast fashion does.

[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=660s) But Patagonia isn't fast fashion prices. You're paying premium for their products. The question is whether that premium goes to actual quality and environmental benefits, or just branding.

[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=690s) My verdict: it's both. Some of the premium goes to genuine quality and real environmental efforts. Some goes to marketing a lifestyle and an image. The ratio varies by product.

[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=720s) Micro Puff Hoody - synthetic insulation trying to match down performance. It's good. Not quite as warm as equivalent down, but water-resistant and ethical (no animal products). For wet conditions, it outperforms down.

[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=750s) The overall quality question: is new Patagonia worse than old Patagonia? It's complicated. Some products yes, some products no, some products are just different. Blanket statements don't capture reality.

[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=780s) If you want vintage Patagonia quality, buy vintage Patagonia. eBay, Worn Wear, thrift stores. It's out there. You'll save money and get the construction quality the internet romanticizes.

[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=810s) If you want new Patagonia, buy what you actually need, use it hard, repair it when possible, keep it forever. That's how you extract maximum value and minimum environmental impact.

[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=840s) Is Patagonia really that good? They're better than most mainstream brands. They're not perfect. They're not saving the planet by selling fleeces. But they're trying harder than most, and that counts for something.

[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=870s) The internet's black and white thinking - "Patagonia is amazing" or "Patagonia is overrated" - misses the nuance. They're a commercial entity doing commercial things while genuinely trying to improve.

[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=900s) My recommendation: if their style works for you and you can afford it, Patagonia is a reasonable choice. If their style doesn't work for you, plenty of other good options exist. Don't buy based on perceived virtue alone.

[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=930s) The products shown in this video: 1970s reverse pile cardigan, 2023 Retro-X Blue, 1988 Retro-X, 2000s Retro-X, 2006 Rhythm Jacket, Point Reyes Gi Pants, Synchilla Fleece, Better Sweater, Recycled Wool Shirt, Vintage Wool Sweater, 50th Anniversary Rugby Sweater, Micro Puff Hoody.

[16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=960s) Not pictured but also in my collection: a few more vintage Better Sweaters, a Velocity Shell, some Chouinard equipment, and my collection of increasingly insane notes on the big P.

[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=990s) After all that research, all that testing, all that reading - Patagonia is a good outdoor brand that makes some great products and some average products, has genuine but imperfect environmental commitments, and benefits from a reputation that sometimes exceeds reality.

[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=1020s) They're not the messiah of outdoor gear. They're not a scam. They're somewhere in between, like most things. Buy what works for you, take care of it, and don't let brand worship or brand cynicism make your decisions.

[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCSNbzQNcI&t=1050s) Anyway, goodbye. Hope Taylor doesn't break up with me after this. Third time's the charm.
