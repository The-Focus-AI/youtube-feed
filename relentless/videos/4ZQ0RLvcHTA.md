# What Happens If A Million Drones Attack Tomorrow | Michael LaFramboise, CEO Aurelius

## Summary

Michael LaFramboise, co-founder and CEO of Aurelius, discusses the existential threat posed by mass drone warfare and his company's laser-based solution for counter-drone defense. The Ukraine war served as the catalyst for starting Aurelius, where drone production ramped to hundreds of thousands per month and 60-80% of Ukrainian casualties are due to FPV drones.

The interview explores why traditional missile-based defense is economically unsustainable (million-dollar missiles vs. thousand-dollar drones), how lasers can destroy drones by cutting off rotors or drilling through the center, and the founder's journey from saying "if I do this thing, no matter what happens, I will fight to the death." LaFramboise shares insights on the fiber optic cable drones that changed battlefield dynamics, the importance of redundancy in defense systems, and why this generation of founders is taking on America's hardest defense problems.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=0s) A million drones show up on the west coast of California tomorrow morning. What do we do? So, if you use a missile, million-dollar cost to shoot down a thousand or ten-thousand dollar drone or even hundred-thousand dollar drone. You can't do that indefinitely. You can do that in small engagements, but if there's any kind of scaled war, you can't do that.

[0:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=25s) This is why we've chosen laser systems to really work on. We destroy the drone. We cut off its rotor. We drill through the center of it, right? It is destroyed. It's not like interfered with electromagnetically.

[0:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=45s) I remember saying to myself, if I do this thing, like if I do this startup, no matter what happens, I will get out there. I will fight to the death. If I lose at the end of the day, I can live with it.

[1:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=70s) This is Michael LaFramboise, the co-founder of Aurelius. They are basically building this station that uses lasers to shoot down drones, which is very based.

[1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=90s) The Ukraine war, there has never been a war with like more drones involved. How has that dynamic started and is shifting?

[2:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=120s) Definitely a lot of like the initial engagement in the Ukraine war was really the onus for John and I to go and start this company. We had seen maybe very early 2024, late 2023, drone warfare kind of proliferating across the battlefield.

[2:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=140s) I don't think at that time the fiber optic cable drones had really come into the fray but drone production was really ramping. You were seeing the production of Russian drones expand like hundreds of thousands per month at that time.

[2:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=165s) And there were people that had been on it for years before that, but that was really the time when John and I were like, we really need to go and get into this. We had seen on the battlefield, you're reading reports where like 60, 70, 80% of Ukrainian casualties are due to FPV drones.

[3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=195s) The fiber optic cable drones changed everything because they can't be jammed. Traditional RF jamming doesn't work. You need a physical kill solution, which is why lasers make so much sense.

[4:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=240s) The cost calculus is brutal. Every time you fire a missile, that's a million dollars. Every time they send a drone, that's a thousand dollars. You're losing 1000 to 1 on cost. In a long war, you just can't sustain that.

[5:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=330s) Lasers flip that equation. The cost per shot is basically just electricity. You can fire thousands of times for the cost of one missile. That's how you defend against swarms.

[8:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=480s) The technical challenge is tracking and targeting. Drones are small, fast, and can change direction quickly. Your tracking system needs to be incredibly precise. A few millimeters off at distance and you miss entirely.

[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=750s) Weather matters a lot for lasers. Rain, fog, dust - they all degrade the beam. You need redundant systems, multiple engagement methods. Lasers aren't the whole solution, but they're a critical part.

[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=1080s) The startup journey in defense is unlike anything else. You're building something that might save lives, might determine the outcome of conflicts. The stakes are real in a way most tech isn't.

[25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=1500s) What keeps me up at night is the timeline. We're racing against adversaries who are scaling drone production faster than we're scaling defenses. Every month matters.

[32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=1920s) The procurement system is designed for a different era. Big programs, long timelines, massive primes. That doesn't work when the threat evolves every few months.

[40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=2400s) Our team is a mix of people from traditional defense and tech. You need both. Defense people understand the requirements, tech people understand how to move fast.

[48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=2880s) Testing in realistic conditions is crucial. Simulations only get you so far. You need to shoot down real drones, in real weather, under real conditions.

[55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=3300s) The ecosystem in El Segundo is incredible. You have all these companies working on related problems. We share knowledge, share talent, push each other to move faster.

[1:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=3900s) China is watching Ukraine very closely. They're learning, adapting. Whatever we develop, they'll have countermeasures. It's an arms race that never ends.

[1:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=4500s) The mission drives everything. When you're building something that could protect American soldiers, protect American cities, the long hours don't feel like work.

[1:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=5100s) To anyone thinking about starting a defense company: commit fully or don't do it at all. This isn't like building an app. The stakes are too high for half measures.

[1:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZQ0RLvcHTA&t=5700s) The drone threat isn't going away. It's going to get worse. Autonomy, swarms, smaller and cheaper. We need to be ready, and we're running out of time.
