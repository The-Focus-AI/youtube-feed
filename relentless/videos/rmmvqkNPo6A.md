# Why Ancient Rome Didn't Industrialize | Casey Handmer, CEO Terraform Industries

## Summary

Casey Handmer, founder and CEO of Terraform Industries, delivers a wide-ranging discussion that spans from terraforming Mars to why ancient Rome failed to industrialize. He explains that while the Romans had the technical capability for industrialization (coal mining, steam engines), entrepreneurs were executed by the emperor for disrupting the status quo. This historical lesson informs his urgency about building critical infrastructure today.

The conversation covers Terraform Industries' mission to produce synthetic natural gas from solar power and atmospheric CO2, creating a pathway to both abundant energy and eventually Mars colonization. Casey shares his philosophy on startup success, comparing it to "playing Factorio in real life" - optimizing production chains and removing bottlenecks. He discusses China's looming demographic catastrophe, the importance of creating incentives to have more kids, and his vision for O'Neill Cylinders and Mars bases.

## Transcript

[0:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=27s) You don't need to be a billionaire to do a space company or do a cool hard tech startup. In the case of Starship, you've got so much methane and so much oxygen that if those mixed well enough, you would end up with the largest non-nuclear explosion in history by a factor of five. China is the only nation that has demonstrated the ability to capture and rendevous with a non-cooperative asset. They can basically go and capture anything on orbit. The US cannot do that right now.

[0:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=55s) This is Casey Handmer and he used to work at SpaceX and now he's started a new company called Terraform Industries. It's pretty sure it's a Mars company long term. Let's talk about like terraforming Mars a little bit. What is the critical path to terraforming Mars to a livable civilization?

[1:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=75s) Well, Mars is a very interesting planet. It's the planet most like Earth. It's already turning at the right speed. It's got roughly the right gravity. It's in the right solar system. It's pretty easy to get to from Earth, all things considered. But it is cold. So, you need heat. That's the main thing. Just heat.

[1:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=95s) And there are many ways of making the planet hotter. But in my opinion, probably the easiest is mass-producing solar cells here on Earth in like some factory in Taiwan and then launching them into Earth orbit and they can fly the rest of the way and then hang out and basically barbecue the planet. How long does a barbecue take? It depends how fast you make them.

[2:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=120s) But you could probably get most of the way there within a human lifetime if you really wanted to. The key insight is that energy is the fundamental constraint on everything we want to do as a civilization. And solar is the only energy source that scales to meet both current and future human needs.

[3:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=194s) Why do you think solar will be our main power source long-term? Solar has this incredible property that it gets cheaper the more you make. The learning curve on solar is about 20% cost reduction for every doubling of cumulative production. We've seen this play out over decades. Nuclear has gotten more expensive. Coal is flat. Gas fluctuates. But solar just keeps getting cheaper.

[5:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=342s) The set of people who have the necessary skills to perform the kinds of government reforms that everyone acknowledges are desperately needed does not intersect with the set of people who would ever have interest in doing it. If you have those sorts of skills, you can make way way more money as a startup or running a company, get more political influence even.

[8:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=517s) The companies I'm interested in starting are the ones that won't be built if I don't build them. There's plenty of companies being started that someone else would start anyway. But Terraform Industries specifically, I looked around and I was like, no one is doing this. No one is trying to solve the atmospheric carbon problem by making it into fuel. So I had to do it.

[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=1195s) I describe what we do as playing Factorio IRL. You're just optimizing production chains, finding the bottlenecks, removing them, and scaling up. It's the most fun you can have with your clothes on. Every day I come in and I'm like, where's the constraint today? Let's fix it.

[22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=1337s) What role does suffering play in greatness? Some adversity builds character. You need some challenges to develop resilience. But too much suffering just destroys people. The key is finding that balance where you're pushed but not broken. The best founders I know have all had some struggle in their background but weren't completely traumatized by it.

[34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=2061s) How does Elon make things happen? First principles thinking. He starts from physics and works backwards. What are the fundamental constraints? Not what has been done before, but what is physically possible? And then he compresses timelines ruthlessly. If something takes a year normally, why not a month?

[50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=3058s) The ancient Romans in principle had the technology to industrialize. They did coal mining on industrial scale. They had steam engines, but they weren't using steam boilers to pump water out of mines. Part of the reason is entrepreneurs being executed by the emperor because they disrupted the status quo. Innovation requires a society that tolerates and even celebrates disruption.

[55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=3350s) We're still using leaded gasoline in aviation. 100LL is still the standard for piston aircraft. Everyone knows it's terrible but the regulatory capture is so complete that we can't move past it. This is what happens when industries get captured by incumbents who benefit from the status quo.

[1:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=3610s) China's looming demographic catastrophe is going to reshape the world. Their birth rate has collapsed. One-child policy combined with preference for sons means they have a generation of men who can't find partners. And their population is aging rapidly while their social safety net is weak.

[1:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=4062s) Creating incentives to have more kids is one of the most important policy problems we face. Right now, having children is economically irrational in most developed countries. The costs are enormous and the benefits are mostly non-financial. We need to change that equation.

[1:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=4336s) O'Neill Cylinders are actually a better solution than Mars in some ways. You can build them to exact specifications. Perfect gravity, perfect climate, no radiation. The hard part is getting enough material into orbit, but Starship changes that math dramatically.

[1:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=4794s) Government is strangling innovation in ways most people don't realize. The regulatory burden on building anything new is enormous. It takes longer to get permits than to actually build. This is why we can't have nice things.

[1:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=5628s) You have to love chewing glass. Building a hard tech company means years of solving problems no one else has solved. If you don't love that process, you'll burn out. The vision isn't enough. You have to love the work itself.

[1:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmmvqkNPo6A&t=5957s) We're closer to becoming critical infrastructure than I ever expected this early. Terraform Industries started as a crazy moonshot and now we're talking to utilities about real deployments. The transition happened faster than I thought possible.
