# How micro1 grew from $4M to $200M revenue in a year | Ali Ansari

## Summary

Ali Ansari, founder and CEO of micro1, sits down with Ti Morse to discuss how his company grew from $4 million to $200 million in revenue in a single year. micro1 started as an AI recruiting tool but pivoted aggressively into the human data space, providing high-quality training data for major AI labs including OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI. Ali explains how the company focuses on hiring, product, and aligning incentives as the three key pillars, and how they use both long-term and short-term incentives to drive explosive growth.

The conversation covers micro1's journey from AI recruiting to becoming a critical data supplier for the biggest AI companies in the world. Ali discusses creating real-world robotics datasets, hiring hundreds of doctors and lawyers in a week for specialized data labeling, and maintaining a "white glove" service standard. He shares the existential crisis the company faced when they nearly lost their biggest customer right before an investor pitch, and how that experience made him temporarily risk-averse before he learned to push through that instinct.

Ali also shares his frameworks for decision-making, including going all-in on data as their core bet, predicting what AI labs will need before they ask for it, hiring as a last resort, and taking big bold bets that have "pretty bad downside but if it works, it works well." He discusses the concept of the Human Happiness Index for data quality, the importance of moving at extreme velocity on two-way decisions, and his model for predicting AI development timelines.

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=0s) I came to the realization that the founder's job is to inject as much risk as they can into the company because really no one else will. Like upside risk -- bold moves that have pretty bad downside also, but if it works, it works well.

[0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=30s) What I focus pretty much entire time on is three things. One is hiring, two is product, and three is aligning incentives. You have to align incentives very long term. When you're in a space that is growing so fast and 3 months can literally double your run rate, you actually do need short-term incentives. Our recruitment team sometimes gets these absurd bonuses if they hire a thousand people. Sometimes we have a customer that is about to sign. I might tell them, "Hey, if this closes, you'll double your equity."

[1:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=70s) Today I have the pleasure of sitting down with Ali Ansari. He is the founder and CEO of micro1. Let's start off with -- I think a lot of the models today are kind of like specific versions like GPT 4 or 5 and so on. But eventually we're going to have these constantly updated models. You specifically are trying to create the super specific high-quality data for constantly improving models all the time. Can you talk about that?

[1:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=105s) Yeah, absolutely. Well first of all, it's good to be here. Thanks for having me, Ti. So I think the way that AI labs are improving their models is by picking domains to improve on and creating reward models within those domains through this notion of RL environments and connecting their policy model which is the model that serves the customers and improving in that domain of choice.

[2:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=135s) Some domains are emergent, which means as you improve in that domain -- coding is one example -- there are a lot of other functionalities that come about that are beyond coding capabilities. Some domains are not emergent, which means you improve a specific capability but nothing else changes. The key is understanding which domains to invest in and providing the highest quality data for those domains.

[2:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=162s) We actually started with an AI recruiting tool. The original micro1 product was a platform that used AI to screen and assess software engineers. We built vetting technology that could evaluate candidates' technical skills, communication ability, and cultural fit in an automated way. That business was doing well, but we saw a much bigger opportunity.

[5:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=342s) Moving into the human data space was the pivot that changed everything. We realized that every major AI lab had the same problem: they needed enormous amounts of high-quality, human-labeled data to train their models, and the existing solutions were too slow, too expensive, or too low quality. Our recruiting infrastructure gave us a massive advantage because we could rapidly source and vet domain experts.

[7:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=439s) The Human Happiness Index is something we developed internally. The insight is that the quality of labeled data is directly correlated with the engagement and satisfaction of the annotators. If someone is frustrated, bored, or confused, their labeling quality drops dramatically. So we measure annotator happiness as a leading indicator of data quality. Happy annotators produce better data.

[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=812s) Creating real-world robotics datasets is one of the most exciting things we're doing. For AI models to interact with the physical world -- whether it's self-driving cars, warehouse robots, or humanoid robots -- they need data from the physical world. We're building teams that go out and collect data in real environments, annotate it with extreme precision, and deliver it to companies building the next generation of robotics.

[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=1023s) We hired hundreds of doctors in a week. An AI lab came to us and said, "We need medical professionals to evaluate our model's medical reasoning." Within a week, we had recruited, vetted, and onboarded hundreds of licensed physicians. Same thing with lawyers -- when they needed legal reasoning data, we had hundreds of attorneys ready within days. This speed is our competitive advantage.

[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=1215s) Providing a world-class white glove service is non-negotiable when your customers are OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI. These are the most important companies in the world right now, and they expect perfection. We have dedicated account teams, 24/7 support, and we treat every single data delivery like our reputation depends on it -- because it does.

[22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=1335s) When I hire, I specifically look for agency and risk-taking. I want people who see a problem and just fix it without asking permission. I want people who are comfortable making bets and living with the consequences. In a hyper-growth environment, you can't have people who need to be told what to do. You need people who figure it out themselves.

[26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=1563s) High velocity on two-way decisions is something I borrowed from Jeff Bezos, but we take it to an extreme. A two-way door is a decision you can reverse. For those, we move as fast as possible. Don't schedule a meeting, don't write a document, just do it. One-way doors -- irreversible decisions -- deserve more thought. But most decisions in a startup are two-way doors.

[27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=1655s) Going all-in on data was the biggest strategic bet we made. We could have stayed as a recruiting company, which was growing nicely. Instead, we bet the company on data being the critical bottleneck for AI development. That bet paid off spectacularly, but it was genuinely risky at the time.

[28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=1732s) Structuring incentives is something I think about constantly. You have to align incentives long term through equity. But when you're in a space growing this fast and 3 months can double your run rate, you also need short-term incentives. Our recruitment team sometimes gets absurd bonuses if they hit massive hiring targets. Sometimes I tell a team member that if a deal closes, they'll double their equity.

[38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=2298s) Leadership and staying in the details is something I feel strongly about. A lot of people say CEOs should delegate and work "on" the business, not "in" it. I disagree, at least at this stage. The founder needs to be deeply in the details of the product and the customer experience. You can't make good decisions from 30,000 feet when the terrain is changing every week.

[40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=2410s) Losing our biggest customer right before an investor pitch was one of the hardest moments. We got a call saying our largest account, representing about 70% of our revenue, was considering churning. And we had an investor meeting in two hours. I had to go into that meeting knowing the numbers I was presenting might not be real by next month. It was absolutely gut-wrenching.

[43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=2604s) After that existential crisis, I became temporarily risk-averse. For about two months, I was playing it safe on everything. Making conservative decisions, hedging bets, building in buffers. Then I realized that was actually more dangerous than taking risks. In a hyper-growth market, playing it safe means you're falling behind. I had to consciously push myself back into risk-taking mode.

[50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=3045s) Taking action as fast as possible when you feel the urge to act is one of my core principles. When you feel that gut instinct telling you to do something, do it immediately. Don't let it simmer. The quality of your decisions doesn't improve with time in most cases -- it gets worse because you start overthinking and rationalizing inaction.

[56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=3372s) What it felt like growing revenue 30x in a year is honestly terrifying. Every month the company is fundamentally different from the month before. The processes that worked at $4 million are completely broken at $50 million, and what works at $50 million is completely broken at $200 million. You're constantly rebuilding the plane while flying it.

[1:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=3648s) Staying focused and limiting new projects is essential during hyper-growth. Every week someone has an idea for a new product or a new market. The temptation to diversify is enormous. But the companies that win during these explosive growth phases are the ones that stay maniacally focused on their core thing and just do it better and faster than anyone else.

[1:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=3750s) Predicting what the big AI labs will want before they ask for it is how we stay ahead. We study the research papers, track the hiring patterns, follow the technical roadmaps. If we can see that a lab is going to need a new type of data in three months, we start building the capability now. By the time they ask, we're already ready.

[1:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=4010s) I created an internal model to predict AI development timelines. It takes into account compute scaling, data availability, algorithmic improvements, and competitive dynamics between labs. It's not perfect, but it gives us a framework for making strategic bets about where the market is going and positioning ourselves ahead of demand.

[1:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=4343s) Hiring as a last resort is counterintuitive for a company growing this fast. But I've learned that every new hire adds complexity, communication overhead, and cultural risk. I'd rather push the existing team to their limit and automate everything possible before adding a single new person. When we do hire, it's because we've exhausted every other option.

[1:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=4705s) Taking big bold bets is the founder's job. I came to the realization that the founder's job is to inject as much risk as they can into the company because no one else will. Everyone else is incentivized to play it safe. The founder has to be the one pushing the boundaries, making the bets that could fail spectacularly but if they work, they transform the company.

[1:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNQeZ_95O0&t=5329s) Long-horizon tasks are the next frontier for AI training data. Current AI models are good at short tasks -- answer a question, write some code, generate an image. But the next generation needs to handle tasks that take hours or days -- research projects, complex debugging, multi-step workflows. Creating training data for these long-horizon tasks is fundamentally different and much harder. That's where we're investing heavily.
