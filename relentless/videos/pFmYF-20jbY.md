# The Greatest World Conquerors In History | Ben Wilson

## Summary

Ben Wilson, creator of the "How to Take Over the World" podcast, joins this conversation to explore the psychology and strategies of history's greatest conquerors and how those lessons apply to modern entrepreneurship. The discussion covers how historical figures like Napoleon, Caesar, and Vanderbilt operated, drawing parallels to contemporary business leaders like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Brian Chesky.

The conversation delves into why great leaders are fundamentally "addicts" driven by an all-consuming passion, how they create and thrive in chaos, the importance of long-term vision versus short-term gratification, and why repetition of core messages is essential for leadership. Wilson argues that the greatest resource lacking in the modern world is vision, as constant digital stimulation has eliminated the boredom that historically sparked ambitious long-term projects.

## Transcript

[0:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=2s) Every great person is fundamentally an addict. So what's your internal monologue when an addict is doing meth or heroin? There's nothing other than the addiction. That's how Thomas Edison felt about inventing. How Steve Jobs felt about designing. How Napoleon felt about conquering. A lot of them have traumatic childhoods. It's so interesting the way in which they won't answer questions about them. It's not like it's so traumatic I can't think about it. It's literally like I'm a shark who smells blood and you're asking me about my childhood. You know what I mean? Like I smell blood. Like I got to go eat.

[0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=30s) Today I have the pleasure of sitting down with Ben Wilson. He is the creator of How to Take Over the World, which is a podcast about awesome world builders and the best company builders in history. I've kind of thought about a question for a while, which is basically where are the Napoleons of today?

[0:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=55s) Well, objectively speaking, they're in private equity. So you know someone went and found a descendant of Napoleon and because he had you know his only legitimate son died young but he had an illegitimate son with this like Polish countess, as one does, and his illegitimate you know great great grandson works for a private equity firm in London and then his greatest opponent was the Duke of Wellington and someone found his descendant and he also works for a private equity firm. So it's like this is the great warriors of our generation. This is where their energies are being focused is into further financialization of the economy. So you know you might think that's better than warfare. I think many people probably do. I don't.

[2:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=122s) To me it kind of feels like the whole you know there's one person that builds the entire lineage and then you know three or four or five generations in the future they've kind of squandered it, right? And I think a lot of the like really wealthy families have basically gone down that path. Yes. So reversion to the mean. Yes, lots of reversion to the mean.

[3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=195s) But you know I think that the Napoleons of today, the next Julius Caesars, they're going to be the great tech founders. That is what I think. I think that like the great um company builders in tech have the potential to like shape things going forward more than any political leader or any general. And that's who I really look to in today's world for the modern day examples.

[5:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=322s) There are no peacetime CEOs. I think the great leaders, I was talking about this with someone else, is they they create chaos. And so you know whether the the market is is a bear market or bull market, whether if it was war time or peace time, they would have created chaos anyway. You know Napoleon lived in a chaotic era. That's when he came up. But the chaos was also of his making, right?

[7:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=478s) I think there's a kind of a like almost hubris of like if the market is uncertain, if things are chaotic and turbulent, that's great for me because I know I can outperform other people. And so, like, founders who love volatility, founders who love chaos, they know, look, everyone is getting their punch in the face. Everyone's getting disrupted. But I'm going to execute better than everyone else so I want this. I don't want things to be stable and predictable because my competitors can then also predict and be stable. Right.

[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=845s) Never debase yourself by having an enemy that's below you. It's this Napoleonic maxim of like be very careful who you choose as your enemies. And there's a sense in which yeah like choosing your enemies is such an important thing and like it's often the mistake of people in this generation that they'll choose trivial enemies.

[17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=1052s) Who will be remembered 500 years from now? People might not know Steve Jobs. They might not know the Beatles. They might not know Obama. But I think they'll know Elon Musk. And the reason is Mars. If humans get to Mars, they're going to know who was the person that was instrumental in achieving that. And if we never get to Mars, they'll still know about the guy who tried to get us to Mars.

[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=1213s) There's this thing called the Lindy effect which is the idea that the longer something has survived, the longer it will continue to survive. And so like books that have lasted 500 years, those are the books that will still be around another 500 years from now.

[48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=2906s) World conquerors live with uncertainty. In fact, uncertainty is the medium in which they thrive. While everyone else freaks out and is paralyzed by uncertainty, they embrace it. And yet at the same time, their number one job for those who follow them is to provide certainty. You provide certainty in an uncertain world. That is like the number one job of a leader.

[50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3059s) Caesar very famously takes out a ridiculous amount of debt - in the equivalent it's like half a billion dollars in debt or something. Ridiculous. But personal debt. And he just keeps going because that's what everyone did essentially in Rome, right? I take on some debt and then I win the consulship or whatever elected office and then I go get a governorship and once I'm a governor, then basically I just screw over everyone in my governorship and take all their money and then pay off all my debts and get fabulously wealthy.

[51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3108s) There's a playbook and Caesar's doing that playbook, but he's just doing it on a scale that no one has ever done it before. He goes from the most in debt man that Rome has ever seen to the wealthiest man that Rome has, maybe even the entire world has ever seen.

[53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3214s) You know it's funny like you go read really great writing and you read something like Zero to One by Peter Thiel and there's a level on which you read it and you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know why? It's because at the time it was revolutionary and he was so right that it has become common wisdom and everyone believes it and everyone repeats it.

[54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3262s) Venture capital is kind of the same thing as Caesar, but it's just turned into an industry and it seems banal to us now because now we have an entire industry around it. But if you think about it, it's kind of Caesar done repetitively, of like we're going to take on all this debt. We've got all these shareholders who are expecting recompense and there's a good chance that we just go bust.

[55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3302s) Bezos is a very good example of repeating the same mantra. You control F for customer experience through his shareholder letters and it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like it's been a decade. You think people got it by now, but they don't get it. Well, it's the whole you aren't preaching to a standing army. You're preaching to a moving parade, I think, is the line.

[55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3331s) One of the things of every great leader, of every great communicator, is the ability to just reiterate past the point where if you've got someone who's locked in, who's listening to every single thing that you're saying, they are bored and they are saying, "Do you have to keep repeating this?" But the answer is yes, I do because there's a fresh audience and human nature is so fickle. People forget. We're literally just forgetting machines.

[56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3385s) The United States gets really fed up with the so-called tyranny of King George III. And so we come up with a system, we win our independence and we come up with a system called the Articles of Confederation which is completely anti-monarchical and has no central control whatsoever. And then you get rebellion you get all these problems that come from having essentially no one in charge.

[58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3492s) FDR was essentially a dictator. That was 80 years ago. That was the last president who was truly in charge of the government of the United States. And so, I think we learned that lesson a little too well. And now we're once again waiting on someone who can be in charge again and cut through some of this red tape and get things done.

[58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3529s) I think the optimal form of the world is you have the government that is not a dictatorship. But then you have on a small scale individual companies as dictatorships. And I think a lot of people especially in government today in the US see Elon and they see that he basically has dictatorial power over his companies and they're like this is somehow wrong. But if you actually look, nothing great is created by committee.

[1:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3612s) There's this temptation which is if we could just get the Constitution just right, human forever. If human incentives weren't the way that they are and like if everyone wasn't corrupt. The United States Constitution has been so successful that we as Americans have this obsession with what does the Constitution really mean. But government form perhaps matters far less than we would like to think.

[1:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3837s) If you look at Travis Kalanick at Uber, he at one point during Uber's growth builds Operation Grayball where he knows that the city governments are going to fight the adoption of Uber. And so what he does is he basically creates a database of all of the local government employees and then creates a fake phantom app which doesn't allow them to use the platform. It pretends that rides are coming and then they just disappear.

[1:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3861s) Vanderbilt at one point has someone confiscate some of his ships. At first he asks for them back. The guy doesn't give them back. Then he tries to pay for them. Doesn't give them back. Then he goes to the US government and says you guys need to get my ships back. They don't step in. Then he goes down there and just kills them, kills the guy.

[1:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3936s) People are just less tough now than they were back then. More precious about life and the loss of life. So yeah, I think there's probably less happening than there was at Vanderbilt's time, but there's also more happening than we know about at any given time.

[1:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=3963s) I think more people should study George Soros. He's done a remarkable job. I think it's been very destructive but it's been remarkably successful in achieving what he's wanted to. I'll say this about George Soros. If I had personally lived through the Holocaust, I think once you realize what he has lived through, I think his viewpoint becomes much more understandable.

[1:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=4041s) The greatest resource lack that we have in the world is not energy, it's not carbon, it's not oil, it's vision. And I think that there is a tremendous lack of vision in the world and there's never been less vision because it's so easy to be distracted. A lot of great vision comes from these moments of just longing that often comes during boredom. And we're never bored anymore.

[1:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=4142s) Look at movies today. Go watch a movie from like the 80s and they're so sexual. Like you're kind of amazed at like the amount of sex that was in these movies. And we have the most sterile, least sexual, least sensual, least erotic generation. And why? Because we're flooded by pornography. There's so many ways to cheaply satisfy all these human motivations that we no longer have these great visions for projects that take decades or hundreds or thousands of years.

[1:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=4219s) One of the things that makes Elon so special is look, he's probably not going to get to Mars in his lifetime. But he's still working on it. That is so rare. Very few people work on projects that will last beyond their own lifetime and that I think is what humanity needs to recover.

[1:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=4418s) Great achievers eliminate optionality. The flip side of having lots of options is you're not going all in on anything. And great achievers go all in. They burn the boats. And it's not even a strategic decision for them often. It's just who they are. They can't help but be all in.

[1:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=5185s) Being willing to look wrong for a very long time is a superpower. Most people can't handle the social pressure of looking foolish. Great achievers are willing to look crazy for years or even decades before they're vindicated.

[1:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFmYF-20jbY&t=5540s) Every great person is fundamentally an addict. The way they experience their calling, their mission, their craft, is indistinguishable from addiction. They wake up and there's nothing else. It's not a choice. It's not discipline. It's compulsion. And that's what it takes to change the world.
