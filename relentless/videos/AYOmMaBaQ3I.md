# SpaceX, Starship, Building A Gas Station On Mars | Halen Mattison, CEO General Galactic

## Summary

Halen Mattison, former SpaceX engineer and now CEO of General Galactic, provides an insider's perspective on SpaceX's culture, the Starship program, and his new venture to build propellant infrastructure in space. He describes witnessing a Dragon capsule explode during ground testing, and how SpaceX's unique failure investigation methodology allowed them to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.

The conversation covers the technical challenges of building orbital gas stations, why China's ability to capture non-cooperative assets in space represents a significant threat, and how SpaceX's iterative development approach revolutionized aerospace. Halen shares his journey from joining SpaceX straight out of school to starting General Galactic, emphasizing that you don't need to be a billionaire to start a space company anymore.

We were going to try to do some test firing on the engine and it just exploded everywhere. I got a call on a Saturday and they were like, 'Yeah, capsule's gone, dude.'"

## Transcript

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=0s) You don't need to be a billionaire to do a space company or do a cool hard tech startup. In the case of Starship, you've got so much methane and so much oxygen that if those mixed well enough, you would end up with the largest non-nuclear explosion in history by a factor of five.

[0:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=28s) China is the only nation that has demonstrated the ability to capture and rendezvous with a non-cooperative asset. They can basically go and capture anything on orbit. The US cannot do that right now.

[0:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=55s) This is Halen Mattison and he used to work at SpaceX and now he's started a new company called General Galactic. Let's just start off with that SpaceX stuff. What's the worst shit that happened while working at SpaceX?

[1:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=65s) Oh man. Well, there's certainly a few things I probably can't talk about for a lot of reasons. I mean I was there when we had one of the Dragon capsules explode during a test firing on the ground. So we had just flown demo one. It's the first time we're flying the Crew Dragon vehicle. And we brought it back and we were doing checkouts on the ground.

[1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=90s) And we were going to try to do some test firing on the engine and it just exploded everywhere. So everything inside got obliterated. That capsule was supposed to fly again. And then I remember I got a call on a Saturday. And they were like, "Yeah, capsule's gone, dude. So we got to figure out what just happened."

[2:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=120s) And that investigation was actually super interesting. I will say that's actually one of the cool things about SpaceX that they probably do better than pretty much anyone else out there is investigate when they screw up.

[2:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=145s) The failure investigation style that SpaceX has crafted has allowed them to figure out a lot of the exceptionally hard problems. How often does something go horribly wrong when they're trying out some new test?

[3:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=190s) Yeah, I mean with new stuff pretty often. And that's actually the point. The whole philosophy at SpaceX is test early, test often. You're going to find out things in testing that you never would have found in analysis or simulation. And yeah, sometimes things blow up. That's how you learn.

[3:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=225s) The traditional aerospace approach is to analyze everything to death before you ever build hardware. SpaceX flips that. Build hardware, test it, break it, learn from it. It's faster and you learn things you never would have discovered on paper.

[5:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=342s) So General Galactic, what we're building is propellant infrastructure in space. Think of it as gas stations for spacecraft. If you want to go to Mars and come back, you need fuel along the way. You can't carry all of it from Earth.

[8:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=495s) The culture at SpaceX is unlike anything else. Everyone is there because they believe in the mission. You're working insane hours but you're doing it because you want to make humanity multiplanetary. That kind of shared purpose is incredibly powerful.

[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=765s) The orbital mechanics of propellant depots are fascinating. You have to deal with boil-off, thermal management, transfer in microgravity. These are hard problems but they're solvable problems. And Starship makes the economics work for the first time.

[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=1100s) A Mars gas station changes everything. Instead of having to launch everything from Earth, you can refuel along the way. It's like the difference between flying direct from New York to Tokyo versus being able to stop in Hawaii. It opens up possibilities.

[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=1530s) SpaceX interviews are intense. They want to see how you think, not just what you know. They'll give you an impossible problem and see how you attack it. Do you ask the right questions? Do you challenge assumptions? That's what they're looking for.

[32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=1935s) Hardware failures are more spectacular than software bugs but the debugging process is actually similar. You start with what you know, form hypotheses, test them systematically. The difference is your test cycles take days or weeks instead of minutes.

[38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=2322s) Test early, test often. Don't fall in love with your analysis. Real hardware will surprise you every time. Better to find out early when the consequences are manageable than late when you've built hundreds of units.

[45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=2718s) I left SpaceX because I saw this massive gap in the market. Starship is going to create enormous demand for propellant in orbit. Someone needs to build that infrastructure. And I realized I could be that someone.

[52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=3130s) Starship changes everything. It's not just a bigger rocket. It's a new economic model for space. When launch costs drop by 10x or 100x, things that were impossible become possible. That's the world General Galactic is building for.

[1:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYOmMaBaQ3I&t=3750s) You don't need to be a billionaire anymore. The tools exist, the knowledge is out there, and the launch costs are coming down. If you have a good idea and you're willing to work hard, you can build a space company. That's the era we're entering.
